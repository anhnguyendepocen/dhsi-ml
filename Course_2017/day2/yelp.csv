Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more.

The first time I was there was on a Saturday, early afternoon in Spring.  I found it strange that I was the only one in the store for about 20 minutes, until another customer came in.  Melrose is usually a pretty happening place during the Spring before summer temps hit.  I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture, mostly living room sets and home decor.  Prices were on the high end for, let's face it folks, used furniture. The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch. So I went back again last week.  Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing).  Yep.  I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me.

After listing and selling a few of these COOL homes I decided that I should be more familiar with a few MCM furniture shops that I could buy or lease a higher quality furniture. 

After going in a bunch of places I can say that I really love this store and cant wait to use them to stage my newest listing in a few months at 24th and Indian School.

First, the service has been excellent and friendly. We're new to the mcm scene and didn't get snubbed at for not being ""in the know"" -- sadly, this was a welcome relief. 

Second, the selection is good. Yeah, it's always a hunt, but at MOM you aren't going to be sifting through, basically, garbage to find your treasures. With most of the weeding done for you, the store is a much nicer visit.",0,0,0,review

My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate, but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop. My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new, as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made. Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA. And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now, because they barely last 1 move. 

Everything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods. We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift, and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off. We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed, but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient.

The same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way, which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store. I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are, but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid). I was very struck by how open and helpful the employee was. Great experience. Great selection. Great prices.",0,0,1,review

I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. 

I was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say ""If you're going to start a sale, finish it!"" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. 

As I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, ""Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!"" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said ""Bitch!"" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. 

It is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. 

Today was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.",4,3,2,review

The store is very well curated unlike many other vintage/antique shops. I spent a few minutes looking around (I don't like to be bothered right away when I come in to a store). Cynthia greeted me warmly and I asked her to help me pick out some bedroom furniture. She asked me about my style preferences and showed me around. She noted what I liked and didn't like and made informed recommendations. It took me all of ten minutes to pick out the furniture I wanted. Cynthia actually asked me if I wanted to take some time to consider my purchase (not pushy at all!) and I told her I loved everything and I wanted to take delivery as soon as possible.

I then asked Cynthia to help me find a pair of lamps for the bed side tables I purchased. This time around I wasn't really loving anything but she took the time again to show me around and listen to my input. 

Another reviewer mentioned that their pieces are pricy and that could not be further from the truth. I had found some lower end shops that did not have the quality I was looking for and I also found some very high end shops. Modern on Melrose has excellent prices and the quality to back it up. I was pleasantly surprised by the value they provide.

I was able to have my furniture delivered the next day and I'm loving my new (old) furniture. I highly recommend you check them out!",0,0,0,review

Okay, if you are a girl and looking for clothes here, I'd say pass. Unless of course you have a tiny waste and are maybe a size 0-4 on a good day. If you are looking for funky earrings, it might be worth a stop, but the majority of their earring inventory was kinda weird and a little too 80's inspired for my retro taste. If you are looking for stellar quality (and priced accordingly) funky retro furniture, then definitely pop in here as their selection is really cool and there were a ton of pieces that I easily would have purchased.

But I went recently...and I just didn't like it. Sure, these are collectible pieces, goregous condition, the space is well cared for, I don't expect to afford these museum worthy pieces, especially at 11grand for a chair and ottoman (oh god, I hope the ottoman was included in that price....), but the affordable pieces of bracelets, earrings, clothing...um, it was a lot of the same items I saw here over a year ago...actually more like TWO years ago.....so, the inventory isn't very turnovering or fresh...so I guess Mint isn't so fresh?

Overall, I was underwhelmed, I didn't feel particularly welcomed either time I was here, and the stock continues to center on polyster 70s clothing and BCBG tops (?) making an uneven style feel and chilly ambiance.

Really great stuff.  A bit high priced, but not when you consider it's quality. Everything they had was great.  It didn't feel like estate sale shopping, ya know?

Then there's the other 1/2 of the store that is an art gallery.  Somehow it just works.  Here the prices were extremely reasonable.  Some really great stuff too.

The only complaint I have is that their hours make it difficult for me to get fuel.  I understand this, however, as most of their business is from bulk specialty fuel sales, not B99 fill ups.  In response to Sara U, you really have nothing to worry about for getting 5 gallons of E85.  Your car is already running on 5-10% ethanol every time you fill up with unleaded.  I wouldn't do it on a regular basis, but it is not like you put diesel in a gas vehicle or vise versa.   Just fill up with regular unleaded, then have somebody clear your check engine light for you.  It will probably throw a code about the O2 sensor, not because it is broken, but because the oxygen content of the E85 is higher.  It shouldn't come back on.  And no, I don't work there.

One can tell by the name that LPW won't replace Ohio's lost Maisonette restaurant in Cincy any time soon, nor does it aspire to do so, but for a sports-bar type venue, these folks do it all right, and do so at the right price!
Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.

The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app.
The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection.
They got the spears vs. chips decision right!

The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare, but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share! 
 
And here's the kicker they were under four bucks! 

Kudos Mr. Pickle; you done good!

The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior, ... the fry guy here knows his craft!
And the burger was good as well.. ...typical of the genre.  

I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger.

The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done.
When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share.
My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce, but rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter.

The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended, but that's a management issue, not the server's fault.

Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented!
I'm all for efficiency, especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant.

That move garnered the fifth star!

Looking for anything to Yelp. Nothing. Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day. There was a deli, but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak. Breezed through Peninsula. Winking Lizard? Bah. Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.

Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome.

- nice patio with misters and adequate seating.  Good location to see the show (even if the show is GOD AWFUL- but I won't rate this place according to the show.  My eyes were bleeding after watching it.)
- decent variety of food selections and full bar
- decor and ambience were pretty nice

Cons:
- food was overpriced for the quality.  I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry.  California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart.  The lettuce wraps were decent appetizers, as was the tempura platter.  We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed.  
- service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way.

No skinny Cambodian-looking girl would have an ass that sticks out ten inches from her back unless she stuck a basketball in there, seriously.  Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess. While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke.  Fun to play with, but weird.  Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? 

The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.  As long as its good, I like it.  

I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked.  I like attentiveness.  I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it.  Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average.

More importantly, there a few restaurants in Las Vegas that offer a more impressive atmosphere.  Anyone comparing it to ""Panda Express"" or even ""PF Changs"" is simply not doing this place justice.  The modern and sleek decor hasn't changed too much from the days it was Social House except for the fact they have added some stunning jade and ivory sculptures on display.

Most importantly, the food presentation, taste and service are well beyond expectations for a ""reasonably"" priced restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.

Can you get Asian food as good or better at a lower price down the street (Spring Mountain) in Las Vegas Chinatown?  Yes, of course, but no where near the same dining experience in terms of location, seating (indoor/outdoor), ambiance, and cool vibe.

I would challenge some of those that previously rated this place less than 4 to give it another try.

The lounge was great.  During happy hour (5-7PM) there are drink and app specials. And since ISLA was packed to the gills, my fella and I decided to check out Khotan.  The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game. 

We were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.

The dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.

We ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.

The pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.

We enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito. (Give me anything with Canton in it and I'm set. Yum.) 

So - let's talk about the service. The servers were polite and great when we saw them.  We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes. This could have definitely had to do with the fact that for a while we were the only ones inside the dining area, but the servers never acknowledged the crap service.  A simple, ""Sorry 'bout the wait"" would have sufficed.  Oh well.

I got the lobster curry. Again, for the price, it was not worth. i can get thai green curry for $5.95 down the street and throw in some steamed lobster and get the same effect. 

hubby got korubuta pork chop. okay, but have had much better elsewhere.

I came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.

I've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.

It's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward!

As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.

Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).

Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).

We really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show.",3,2,3,review

I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you. And it is awkward to sit with a bunch of people you don't know. However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice. 

Considering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).  

In terms of the ""show"" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive.

Should have just had the nachos as that was a meal in itself. If you have ever had Big Dogs' nachos you know what I am talking about. The order is so big, it would easily feed four or so. We asked them for a half order and still it was a huge portion. They layer the cheese in between the chips and pile on the sour cream, jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes and guacamole. You can add meat like chicken, taco seasoned beef, or shredded beef for just a little bit more. 

Once they have it all together under the salamander it goes and it's heated all the way through. So the chips on the bottom are just as warm, crunchy and smothered in cheese as the ones in the middle and on top. 

My bratzel is a hamburger with bacon, bratwurst sausage, crispy thin rings of onion, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and of course the pretzel roll. Cut this baby up into four's it's enormous. I enjoy Big Dog's its always fun to dine in or late night, eat at the bar.",3,0,1,review

I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich on foccacia, which came with roasted peppers, mozzarella, and yum, sauteed spinach and garlic.  It would have been outstanding if they'd only heated the foccacia to crisp it up.  Instead of the fries or cole slaw, I sprang for the extra two bucks to change it up for a salad.  I expected a tiny side salad, but this was really big, with lots of chopped tomatoes, cuke, cheese, and romaine.  It was missing olives, but that was great:  I hate olives!  By the time I got halfway through the salad, I felt like I'd already eaten dinner.

My husband ordered the walleye special.  I thought it was pretty high-priced at $20, but it came with the aforementioned salad, plus two sides. But when they brought out the plate, I saw the reason for the high price: the piece of fish was absolutely monstrous.  It could have fed a small third-world nation, but my husband lives to eat, so he managed to devour half of it before throwing in the towel.  It became my dinner on Saturday night, and I thought it was fabulous!  I also appreciated the fact that it wasn't over-salted.  Next time we go we'll both order it, and we'll be able to eat for a week!

One of the other couples ordered the same as us.  The guy from the third couple had the burger with bratwurst and, I think, bacon, plus some kind of cheese.  He liked it a lot.  His wife wasn't feeling very well, so she just ordered some tuna salad on a plate.

My ridiculous burger topped with a brat, and cheese, and onion strings, and bacon was amazing. I'm not sure if the burger meat itself was good because I was in topping heaven.

Well it has been about two years since I was here last for a less than memorable dining experience. You know those times you have dined at an establishment and had great food then you boast to a friend on how good it was. Then you take that friend to eat there and it is a complete disaster and not good at all! Well that is what happened here about two years ago so that is why I have stayed away for so long.

This just goes to show that an establishment can change for the better or worse after time, in this case luckily was for the good! I know my fellow Yelper and good friend Karen is going to shake her head and laugh when she reads this review! lol You can also read her review from when she posted about our crappy horrific visit as well.

This was one of those nights where you want to dine out however can't decide on a place so this is where hubby and I ended up.

We got there late however the basketball game was still playing so our server invited us to take advantage of happy hour as she would honor it for us. So I got a whiskey and coke for $2 and my sweetie decided on a Dog's Draft choice beer for $2 to start our meal off!

Their special this Tuesday night 3-10pm only was a half slab of BBQ baby back ribs, coleslaw and fries for $9.95. I must admit this meal was finger licking good with the fall off of the bone rib meat. The coleslaw was sweet and delicious as well really complimenting this meal along with the great golden fries. It is a lot of food for the price making a great special that I would order again for sure!

My hubby decided on the Brewer's Sandwich, a johnsonville beer brat and a red Klement's smoked brat topped with grilled onions, sauerkraut & Swiss cheese on grilled rye with beer mustard. Served with garlic fries. His meal looked delicious and he really enjoyed it a lot!

We decided for dessert to share their Big Dog's Brownie Sundae a warm, gooey, homemade chocolate brownie, topped with  häagen dazs vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chopped peanuts. drizzled with hot fudge. It was very good!

The service was good as our server was friendly and attentive with a smiling face which made us feel comfortable.

They make their own beer, something that I've found to be pretty rare here in Vegas.  While most bars are offering you a choice of Bud, Bud Light or Coors, Big Dog's offers those PLUS about 8 of their awesome microbrews!  If you're a beer lover, you gotta try their IPA!  It's simply heavenly!  They usually have their regular IPA but once in a while they also offer War Dog, a knock-you-on-your-ass 9% alcohol imperial IPA!  It is SO GOOD but beware, as you really only need to drink one.  I would also recommend the stout and pale ale.  Skip the bizarre wheat beer... it tastes like root beer to me for some weird reason.

Big Dogs is basically a PTs with microbrews with a cafe attached. You walk into the big Dog House. The bar area is 21 plus, it's smokey, and there are various video poker machines.
The restaurant is on the left half of the building. There is a section of hi-top seating which allows seating; the larger dining area is lined with booths and scattered tables. 

I've never had a bad meal here, ever. Even those that I didn't like that much were based on my own taste buds (I just don't like brats, never will). They offer up amazing soups and cheese curds. If you are feeling indulgent, order some of these bad boys. They are gooey cheesy, beer-battered perfection. Seriously, my mouth is watering as I type this.

Some of my go-to regulars are the Southwest Steak salad, the pulled pork sandwich, fish and chips, and grandma's pot roast. They offer fries, coleslaw, potato salad, or sweet potato fries. 

Service is always prompt and friendly. The place doesn't feel overly clean, but I think that has to do with the indoor smoking and dim lighting.

First off, while it's probably not so, you just get the feeling that nothing in the place is clean.  It's old.

I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.

I was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.

I watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying ""Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!"".....she replied ""I know""......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!

This is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.

Back to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.

The Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.

I took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.

Will I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.",10,5,6,review

Compared to Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale, this is a lot smaller, but there is still at least 20 places to choose from including some of the newer entries into the food court wars (Big Smoke Burger, Amaya Express, SU&SHI, Shanghai 360, Chipolte, Szechuan Express) plus the older ones (A&W, KFC, Manchu Work etc.).

Overall, it's not a bad place to eat if you are on your lunch, can't decide what to eat or are just hanging out at the mall, but not worth a special drive (it is a food court after all right?)

Good:  Use of actual stainless steal cutlery, melamine trays, bowls, cute condiment containers, cups, etc.  Newly renovated eateries, washrooms, seating. 

Bad:  Not enough seating, especially at peak times, considering the amount of eateries, and there aren't any visible garbage/recycling bins, so as a diner, you can either leave your tray/trash on the tables OR bring your tray to the station to have someone else clean up after you.  :(

This is not a good message to insinuate to shoppers.  Instead, I think Food Central should promote a more community-like attitude such as ""please clean up after yourself"" and set up different bins - similar to IKEA/Whole Foods - so that everyone can do their part!  

There are already enough lazy slobs out there, we don't need to raise a new generation of them.

As of now, Food Central is not 100% complete, still uneven flooring around outskirts.",1,0,0,review

I worked at Square One for several years back when I was in university and remember the food court quite well...it was my savior on the (many) occasions that I would forget to bring my lunch to work. How I didn't pack on twenty pounds at the time is beyond me. It was adequate back then, if pretty standard. Now with a lot of malls stepping up their game, it's nice to see that Square One has followed suit.

Everything has been redone and renovated and it has a nice and modern look, although it does look a little cold and sterile compared with how it used to. Lots of new places as well as the old, so there really is a good selection. It's still overpriced and often dull mall food but at least you have options. They've also made the switch to reusable cutlery and dishware, which is obviously great. 

All-in-all it's still a food court in a mall, but at least it's a pretty decent one with a lot of choices.

i had fairly high hopes for this place based on the yelp reviews id perused so i was very let down when it turned out that i had been mislead ...

first of all the good : the decor , if trying a little too hard to create a ""fine-dining"" type of atmosphere , is pleasant and i really liked the artwork on the walls featuring the nepalese (or indian ?) countryside .  the music was also nice traditional indian music .  the servers were very pleasant ; they kept their distance and didnt offer much banter but were kind , polite and attentive .

the bad :  THE FOOD !  after waiting quite a while in an empty restaurant to receive our order , we thought that maybe this was a good sign as some of our meal was being prepared ""fresh"" .  sadly this was not the case except maybe for the bindi masala which was slimy and undercooked .  the aloo gobi featured very hard cauliflower and stale tasting , dried out potatoes .  most disappointing was the butter chicken which was VERY tough and dry .  the sauce was not rich at all - definitely couldnt detect any butter and very little cream .  the tomatoes didnt lend any sweetness as they should but instead made the dish quite bitter .

the naan was okay .

if we hadnt had a discount through groupon , it would have felt like a complete rip-off .  the potions were VERY tiny and all four members of our party left very dissatisfied .

no offence to the other reviewers but im wondering if maybe the higher rating is partly due to the large student population in the area ; maybe this place is earning high praise from people who have little experience with indian food or what torontos competitive dining scene really has to offer ?",0,1,0,review

Tried out dinner here last week for the first time. 

I find the menu slightly overpriced. Most of the curries were $15 and that did not include rice or naan. Given this is the ANNEX and the decor/ambiance of this place is quite underwhelming, I think they are overcharging by a few dollars. Other similar type places with much better food (Banjara) have a more reasonable price point.

My date and I ordered the Dinner for Two special ($36.99) which was definitely the most bang for your buck. You get a platter of tandoori chicken, boti kabob and chicken tikka (two pieces of each), a lamb curry, mutter paneer, peas pulav and 1 order of rice and 1 naan. Some kind of rice pudding for dessert too.

Food was pretty tasty, didn't blow my mind but was definitely good.

Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.

The ambiance is where it looses a bit of cache for me.  There was a sort of awkward white guy playing a sitar in front of what must be the lunch-time buffet station.

They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them. 

The food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable.

I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.

We ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.

Within a matter of days, I was surprised to have received an extremely apologetic response via Yelp from the owners of Mt. Everest Restaurant.  They apologized for the inconvenience they may have caused my party, informed me that the staff was briefed about the situation and that new staff has been consequently hired, and offered me a coupon for my friends and me.  

Although I have yet to go back (I'm pretty sure I would despite the disappointing service I faced the second time I went), I have decided to up the rating for the restaurant because I am entirely impressed by the fact that the restaurant owners are both concerned with and responsive to the opinions of their customers.""

I went back with a group of five friends to Mt. Everest after claiming the coupon.  As they had promised, the service was much improved--the service was fast and the meal was as expected delicious. I'm pretty sure they were unaware that I had previously complained on yelp about their terrible service, so I'm hoping that my experience was unbiased. With their improved service and same excellent quality of food, I am changing my review to five stars.

After the first visit to Mt Everest for lunch buffet, I was utterly blown away by the quality of the food.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of selecting Mt Everest for a class dinner two weeks later.  We waited an hour and change for our orders to materialize; by then we were late for class.

The lunch buffet isn't the cheapest ever, but it's all-you-can-eat, so skip breakfast!  They are a lot more careful with food preparation for dinner (i.e. meat is boneless, selection is better) but you know what?  I get the lunch buffet anyway, since it's just so tasty.

We never manage to spend under $50, which is a shame since I'd like to incorporate this restaurant into daily life.  However, for a treat, this place is definitely classier than its price range specifies.  Friendly, undervalued/underrated, tasty, and tasteful.  Highly recommended.",0,0,0,review

Okra is my favourite vegetable when it comes to Indian cuisine and I order it whenever I can. Mt Everest's bhindi masala over some uninspired rice left me satisfied (it's actually way better as reheated leftovers) and I enjoyed the nice spicy kick to it, but the garlic naan was flat out disappointing. I'm a bit of a garlic naan connoisseur and I am not quite sure what to even say about what I tried because there was not much to it. It wasn't garlicky in the slightest, not even buttery, and the naan's texture was dry, tasteless, and chewy in an unflattering way.

I am for sure willing to give Mt Everest a second shot because I walk past it all the time and would really like to try some of their other items, but first I need to recover from this meal that cost over $30 (two entrees, rice, and naan - really?) and a bit of an upset stomach.",1,2,1,review

I ordered butter chicken, naan and drinks. The delivery was done in 30 minutes which is very good when compared to delivery times of other Indian restaurants. 

The food:

1. Butter Chicken: Delivery quantity was very small when compared to the actual dine-in quantity. The chicken tasted as if it was just put into the butter chicken gravy and served. We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good. Being an Indian, I can easily differentiate good butter chicken from the rest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the best I have had in Toronto. 

3 out 5 stars.

2. Naan: The Naan was a horror story. It wasn't cooked well. I could taste the raw flour which made them inedible for us. Apart from that, the naan smelled very bad.

One of the servers sat us down at a 'waiting' table in the front and said the table would be ready in about 20 minutes. He put down a couple of poppadums and then vanished. 35 minutes went by, the waiting area was getting pretty crowded. We were getting antsy by now. My friend went and found the guy and asked him for an update 'only 5 minutes sir!'

I had enough and said- look, either we sit asap or we can leave, to which he replied - not possible today...human error...

we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos.  so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food.   the momos were absolutely deeeelicious.  they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone, but if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy.  the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think.  that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something.

then the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan.  that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure.  the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms.  the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery.  what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert.

the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats.

the rice puddings were fine, tasty, but i dont think itd be my first pick of deserts in general.

Ordered the Fish Pakora, and Shrimp Masala with Naan. It took about 30-40 minutes for my entree to arrive, and what's worse, is they got my order wrong.

The decor was nice and understated. Waiters were super attendant and polite!  So off to a good start.

What we ordered:
Momos
Jhane ko dal
Aloo tama bodi
Lamb Briyani
Raita

When asked how hot - we selected medium. Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.

The food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be ""cooked"" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).

Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive! Which is rare for a unique dining experience downtown.

Food. We ordered the following:
Naan bread
Butter Chicken
Chicken Tandoori-nice and hot as it was served on a sizzling hot place. Some parts got charred.
Basmatic rice
Lamb Gosht recommended by the host-I found a lot of the pieces to be dried. Perhaps the leg of lamb would have been better.

Verdict. I liked the butter chicken and chicken tandoori. I didn't try the naan but my dinner companions raved about it.

I had made it my mission that the first Indian restaurant she tried would have to be the best if I wanted to make a convert of her- and I was only going to get one chance at it... thankfully the server picked up on that and made some suggestions and was very kind explaining to her the signature dishes there. We got the Butter Chicken and the Chicken Tikki Masala (the server said the chef LOVES to make the Tiki Masala) and shared the rice and naan.

The Sitar player is quite good, but loud. Watch where they seat you, he may just be on break and then when the party gets started up again, boy are you in for a ear-ful.  
I wanted to try the Nepalese specialties only. So, we ordered 2 naan and 2 dishes- the daal-like dish and the spinach dish. This was way more food than we could have eaten! But, considering we were headed to the theatre, didn't take any leftovers anyway.  But, price wise, the dinner for 2 is an amazing deal.

Based on the positive reviews here for Mt Everest, and being that I've never had Nepalese food before, I pushed to give it a try. We only ordered some garlic naan, plain rice, and two entrees:

1. Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black beans in mountain spices)
2. Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)

The dishes were both tasty! I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious.

Additionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order. There was more than enough to cover both dishes. The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1:1.

Which brings me to why my review is only 2 star. The portions! First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese. Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed.

No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself.  With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying ""Please seat yourself.""  

So you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all.  Next you have to wait for someone to give you a menu to see what they actually serve.  You would think that menus would arrive very shortly, but I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive.  I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile.

I could go and on about how long it took for my experiences here.  What I found out on two lunch visits that the owners are the servers as well.  No problem at all with this if you are good at what you do and are speedy.  However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner then it's time to hire some help.  Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food.

I'll remind you that the food is really good, but everything takes forever.  My recommendation is to try takeout.",1,0,0,review

The chips and salsa were excellent, hot and chunky salsa. 

Food: I had the two soft taco meal with rice and beans. I mixed the tacos one with Chicken and one with Beef. The beef was carne asada on two small corn shells. Topped with pico. The chicken was chopped into cubes and was ""day old"" at best. It was not fresh. Topped with pico.

The rice was good but I have had better, the beans were ok but really lacked flavor. 

The ""lunch"" was about 10 bucks and I felt cheated. Maybe I am not a Jalisco style fan?",4,3,4,review

This is Halisco style food - not the same! Think of it as more of a gourmet style Mexican restaurant. And b) they ordered the chicken tacos. Admittedly, they sort of suck. I've been coming here with my family for years! After they moved across town to the new location, we followed.

Ambiance: It's a CUTE restaurant with an old town Mexican theme. Subdued lighting with eccentric and rich coloring.

Service: You are evil spawn if you don't like M&M. They work hard and are the loveliest people ever! They are friendly and remember you if you go there often enough. He looks angry but I swear he's super nice. She's so warm and welcoming and knows my order every time I go in.Thanks.

Food (and none of it is greasy!):
+ Pork chop/cube with green sauce: INCREDIBLE. OMYGOODNESS. They're soft. They're savory. They're moist. They couldn't be better. They make me want to sing my praises from the rooftops of Phoenix.
+ Chicken tacos: Skip them. They are kind of disappointing.
+ Chicken tortilla soup: AMAZING. Seriously. I have yet to find one that's better. It's spicyyy and will clear your sinuses! Mmm.
+ Refried beans: Fantastic. The best I've had, and believe me, I am well versed in Mexican food. If anyone knows beans, it's me.
+ Chips and salsa: The chips are freshly deep fried, so they're wonderful and crunchy. The salsa is great. One is chunky and mildly hot, while the other is super smooth and super hot. Both taste amazing.

And the best of all: their always-spotless utensils, plates, and tables make me endlessly happy. So clean :')",1,0,1,review

When I walked in the door the first room was completely empty and there was a woman standing and staring at me. I turned to look at the sign and turned back around. She still said nothing. I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (but why the hell are you just staring at me like you are not). She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room. I said sure. Both rooms are fairly small. The decor is pretty whack. Old office looking carpet and old booths. I'm a fan of tile in restaurants. Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet. The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean. The benches were old and had tears in them. There were 3 gentlemen in another booth and other than that the place was empty. 

We were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly but no salsa. Another couple came in and sat down after us and were given chips and salsa immediately. Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order. Still no chips and salsa. About 15 minutes into our ""quick"" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa. The salsa was ok. Nothing special. Same for the chips. We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes. 

I had the El Conquistador burrito. Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac. It was ok. Really nothing good or bad. For 7.50 I expect greatness in a burrito. The wife had a bean and cheese burro w/ enchilada sauce. They were very tight on the sauce and cheese. It was the overall theme of the place. Very tight. For extra chips and salsa it was 1.50 according to the menu. 

The waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were. I said we were ready to go now. She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly. Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go. No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done. Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid. 

From the conversations I heard the man and woman own the place. Good for them. I wont be back and don't recommend anyone else going back. I saw a newspaper article on the wall that AZcentral or New Times recommended it as a top 10 Mexican restaurant in town. Maybe it was good before they moved to this location. Maybe they lost some key staff members. Maybe they know something I don't. I doubt it.",1,1,1,review

I thought I would be a cooler Phoenician if I could make this my new ""my place."" 

Perhaps we hit on an off night (just a random Saturday), but our service was horrible. I was taking my neighbor out for dinner, and her comment was that ""we could have died back here and they wouldn't notice."" We waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came over to give us menus or take a drink order. We alerted them that it was our first time in the establishment and asked for recommendations, which were given but wtih minimal enthusiasm. We tried giving ""the eye"" or ""the nod"" and stopped short only of getting up to refill our own drinks during the meal. 

On the plus side, the food was very good and I have been craving it since my initial visit! I had a combination plate that let me taste a yummy chili relleno, taco and enchilada -- all were fantastic. My neighbor got the special (seafood enchiladas) and raved about hers as well.

Very conflicted feelings.

I have gone here a few times when they were located on 32nd and Greenway. Every experience was a little different.

The good-
-Sometimes the service was good. Maybe it depends on their mood. When it was good it was usually the wife who was our server. She kind of reminded me of one my aunts. Warm, slightly teasing, calling us ""bambinos"". 
- I have always liked the food. I have had the chili relleno and enchiladas entrees. Both were a solid 7 out of 10. The beans are very tasty too.

The bad-
- When the service was bad it was usually the husband. Not friendly. Slow. Wouldn't refill our waters and soft drinks. Yet seemed attentive and talkative to other tables. Made us feel like total crap.
- Slightly overpriced.
- Charged for extra chips and salsa.
- My husband didn't like the food.
- Probably my worst experience was when I called at lunchtime to place a to go order. She said they couldn't take the order because they had a huge table of people. Just flat out refused. Guess what I wanted? Just a bean burrito! It takes 30 seconds to make.

They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.

I invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.

So we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.

The food was mediocre to bad.  

I had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.

Steak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.

Other friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.

But the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to ""try""), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  

We were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)

In any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.

Judging by recent reviews, they're certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that's too bad.",1,0,1,review

So, Yoga Oasis is great for me.  I think two other Charlotte-area studios have Bikram-inspired classes, but Yoga Oasis has the best and most true-to-form Bikram classes in our area.  If you are into Vinyasa this studio is not for you.

Obviously the studio is hot -- that is an integral part of the practice, so if you are going to complain about the heat you need to go to a non-hot class at another studio.  The ""fire"" and ""water"" classes are not as hot as the traditional classes, so if you are a beginner you may want to start there.  The heat is part of the challenge and can be tough even for those who have been doing Bikram for years, so give yourself some slack until you get used to it.  (Your body WILL get used to it!)

The instructors are great -- extremely friendly and willing to spend time with you to get your technique right.  A few are too chatty in class for me -- I appreciate reminders and pointers (""chin up"", ""curl tailbone forward"", etc.) but I think some of the instructors get talking and forget how long we have been holding the postures.  I don't like moving too quickly, but I do get impatient when I know that the chattiness is going to lead to the class going over the time period.  Most of the instructors are sensitive about the length of the class but some are not -- it is not unusual to be 10-15 minutes over.  This drives me a little crazy since I am always on a tight schedule. I wouldn't say that the instructors are motivating... but they do notice when you are giving 100%.   Many of the instructors make an effort to get to know you by name and are always happy to see you.

The studio is clean.  The hot yoga room is large and mirrored with carpet.  The carpet is kind of gross but as long as you are on your mat it doesn't matter.  There is no music during class, and no talking in the yoga room.  This is different from many of the other studios around town.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and introspective.  The yogis that attend class are serious about Bikram and are generally very nice.  There is one large lady who is always naked in the shower/changing room -- and will stand there completely naked forever and talk to whomever is in the room.  The shower/changing room is pretty crowded so it is very awkward.  I am glad that she is comfortable with her naked body but I am not.  #gross

Anyway, the yogis are generally not pretentious and not the ""Myers Park stay at home mom"" crowd that you'll find at other studios.  These are lifelong serious yogis and I love that about this place.  The students are very diverse - men, women, all ages, all races, all body types.  And, all are at different levels of their practice.  It's refreshing.

Another major plus about Yoga Oasis is the price -- $75 for 10 classes ($60 if you are a first-time student).  This is cheaper than many of the ""good karma"" deals at other studios!  It is seriously worth every penny and then some.

All in all, this is a great studio and I will keep coming back.  I am only giving 4 stars because of the limited class schedule and the frequency that the class goes over the sixty or ninety minute period.  Oh, and the carpet.  Other that those things, this place is perfect!",3,0,1,review

The best shape (physically and spiritually) that I have ever been in was when I practiced Bikram yoga very regularly in CA; and I would LOVE to do it again.  This is evidently the only place in Charlotte that actually does something like a Bikram sequence (most of the classes I attended at Yoga Oasis were a 60 minute variance with some poses I did not like called water sequence).  The instructors were average (no personal attention or verbal tips on the poses); but very nice.  Since there is no other non-vinyasa practices here (like Bikram) that are not based around shoulder based Vinyasa flows (i.e., down-dog and handstands), I would have probably stuck with this studio but I just can NOT get away from the mildew/fungal smell that pervades the practice space.  I REALLY tried to get past it; but it is just too distracting and disturbing - did not leave me feeling healthier.

Everyone here is SUPER friendly and laid back and relaxed.  I like how the instructors know that everyone is at different levels and the instruction in the classes are super detailed (no matter how many different levels of experienced people are in attendance).

Now, I'm not bikram expert... but I've definitely enjoyed the experiences here and also the challenge of the heated room.  I tend to get to class early so I can stake a spot (not underneath a heater) so I don't get too woozy during class, but the heat does really help with stretching and loosening of muscles.  Last class I grossed myself out a bit since there was a pool of my own sweat on my mat (I need to get a bigger towel).

I've also attended a non-bikram class here and it was good.  Though I am not a fan of the ""downward dog"" pose.... it's good to know this studio offers more than bikram because I can understand why bikram is not for everyone.

I was annoyed by the offerings in Charlotte and found that yoga wasn't the best thing for my body during that time. I recently decided to try yoga again. After a poor experience last weekend at another studio, I decided to return to Old Faithful.

I am so glad I went back. I did the Yin Yoga class with Elaine, whom I remember from back in the day. It was wonderful and relaxing--yet challenging--so I was definitely not bored. I knew it was time to limber up because I had been experiencing lower back tightness and foot pain. This deep, long stretch class was just the thing I needed. I left feeling supremely calm and my body soothed. I'm going to make weekend classes (and maybe some weekday evening ones) a habit. I'm willing to drive out of my way a bit for the relaxing atmosphere, challenging classes, great prices, and quality instruction.",1,0,0,review

It wouldn't be fair for me to NOT write a review and keep going. I love this place so much! Lee Elaine and Tony are all amazing. They fully explain what each posture is doing for your body. You can take Yoga anywhere, but the atmosphere is what really draws me to this place. Everyone is super friendly, the smell of incense and/or candles welcome you in . The dressing rooms are super cute with  cubby's to keep your belongings. I love that there is no contract and you can purchase packages as you go. I tried to ""cheat"" on Yoga Oasis by stopping in another studio (I'll leave them nameless). I didn't get the same treatment and the atmosphere was completely different, I quickly ran back to The Yoga Oasis. My favorite classes are Hot Yoga, Yin and Deep Stretch. Qi Quong was amazing also, but only offered in the Fall. I hope to attend on a more frequent basis in 2016.

I was originally a hardcore hot yogi, but I've been branching out and coming to appreciate other types of yoga, particularly yin. I really wanted to love this place because they offered so many yin classes.

 When I first joined, the teacher checked me in, overcharged me and had no idea how to work the computer.  She also didn't tell me anything about where the studio was or any logistics.  Not a big deal, but front table staff/volunteers may be something to consider.

You know when you go to yoga class with a good teacher-he/she gets you in the right headspace, explains the poses well, and helps set the tone....this was not that.  I could have done it at home and probably gotten more out of it.  I mean she got you in the pose, but didn't tell you how to modify or how/when to use props.  there were a few positions where several people were obviously struggling and still there was no ideas or tips for modifying the poses.  As far as the meditative aspects, she didn't contribute a whole lot besides ""focus on the breath"".  I'm sorry, but I like a yin yoga class with props, modifications, and readings from the Bhagavad Gita/sutras/poetry, exploring a theme, nice yogaisms being said, etc.  Like why even have a teacher in the room if they don't contribute anything beyond ""sit with your legs in front of you and fold over"".  There wasn't even any talk about finding your edge!

You may try their yin class and like it....until you go try yin somewhere else and see what you're missing out on.  The room was a great space as far as lighting and openness.  Think they have carpet though which makes me cringe thinking about the microbes and sweat in those fibers.",0,0,0,review

from what i understand, in order to teach bikram that's all you can teach...   in order to provide many different classes such as vinyasa, detox flow, yin, and various seasonal yoga classes...  this studio could not specifically call themselves a charlotte bikram studio... i may be wrong though... 

those instructors including the owner that teach the bikram style are in fact bikram certified... a bikram certified teacher teaches bikram and cannot say they teach bikram unless they are certified... so says bikram...   

this review is for those that want to explore bikram with the ability to expand their practice into a more fluid and graceful practice...  bikram was my thing when i started off in 2005... as i dedicated more time to my practice i turned more toward vinyasa and a more fluid approach... the yoga oasis provided for this foundation... 

the other classes mentioned above and the instructors that teach these classes are top notch... there is no pressure for perfect poses... yoga practice rather than yoga perfect is the 'mat' standard... there are always options provided for each asana and flow sequence depending on where you are in your practice... instructors will break down sequences... are always available after class for questions, comments, and feedback... always open for suggestions... 

this yoga studio is friendly... interested in your well being...  and always clean...

The teachers are about average compared to other Bikram teachers.  The lounge area is too small for more than 5 people to congregate/socialize.  

As with most Bikram studios, the heat is very inconsistent and very uncomfortable on many occasions.  This studio applies heat by forced draft.  There were many times when the air was so dry that the sweat dried immediately to my skin.  

The instructors are kind for the most part (aside from getting berated for drinking too much water in the ""front row""), but are not very motivational.

I really only have two complaints: 1) the room had carpet... people sweat a LOT in hot yoga, so it grossed me out knowing the carpet had sopped up sweat from countless yogis, I hope they shampoo it regularly & 2) the hot yoga class wasn't super challenging, we did a lot of standing and back bends -while there were several poses I couldn't complete because my hamstrings are so tight, I didn't feel like I got a true workout in. 

I'm going to return soon and try a more challenging class in hopes that I get both a good strech and a great workout at the same time. I would highly recommend the 26&2 hot yoga class for anyone new to the hot yoga experience, just make sure you bring a towel and lots of water!",1,0,0,review

ug5w2Ui7dqZhuv-UlzTKwQ,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ,3,2012-03-28,"Pallucci is a quaint Italian restaurant located in the Mount Pleasant/Davisville area.  If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.

The menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.

The house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!

The starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.

We opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.

For mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.

My dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.

To finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.

Verdict:

The staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.

The food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development.",0,0,0,review

Waltzed into Hazelrock on Opening Weekend and I think I ruined someone's video/picture.  Oops?  I came here because my dearest friend told me to so I did!  I had snooped on their website and blog the week before so I knew I *had* to try the Ferrero cookie on top of some other goods.  Between the two of us, we had a cookie, a lemon bar that was recommended by the friendly barista with the cool hair, a macchiato, and an iced tea.  

The first sip of the espresso sent me straight onto Cloud 9.  It was rich, fragrant, and creamy.  It made Addiction stir and I was hooked by that vixen.  Girl, I will never give you up again.  The iced tea helped clean the palate as well as that super tasty and tart lemon bar.  Could this be fresh lemon juice?  If it was concentrate, it fooled me.  As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.  I wish they drew a tiny leaf in my espresso...

The coffee shop itself is very hipster industrial chic --- wood, steal, a bike, a marquee arrow, a mattress sans the cover and fluff, and glass bottles as lighting. It was very cool.  I like the concrete floors and all the reclaimed wood.  I could imagine a young Joyce sitting here with all her other art student friends, the WP Carey business majors working on their stuffy group assignments on the leather couch and arm chairs, and the regular Tempe resident grabbing a cuppa before work.  It's a large space with lots of chairs, stools, and tables for all. 

And if the drinks and pastries aren't enough to lure you in... they also sell snow.  SNOW!

My girlfriend and I arrived in the mid afternoon on a fairly slow day. The space was nice and open - this place would do well for those looking to study. I couldn't help but notice however the modern chicness of it all, which did come across as semi-contrived. But whatever, it still gave good energy. 

The menu looked interesting and expansive. There were a few choices on there I haven't seen before, such as a coconut cold brew, or a hazelnut milk latte. After some questions about the various drinks, bean sources, etc, I opted to go for the hazelnut milk latte with white chocolate added. My girl had a Brazilian hot pour coffee coffee with hazlenut milk on the side. Tempted by the tasty looking pastries, we also decided to get a peach pie. It was a pie and coffee kind of day.

We noticed immediately that there was something off about the hazelnut milk. I was expecting something silky and slightly creamy, like good almondmilk can be. What we got tasted like wet chalk. Nasty. I had them remake my girl's coffee, and I stuck with mine. I wasn't content at all, but didn't want the hassle of them remaking two drinks. So hers came back, this time with steamed milk; but still, the coffee just wasn't good. I'm sorry - it wasn't. She and I both agreed that it tasted little better than Folger's. There was no depth, no fruit or chocolate notes, nothing. And this coming from a pour over! I can't imagine what a drip brew would taste like. 

My latte, aside from the persistent chalk texture, also had no flavor. The white chocolate was non-existent. The espresso, barely distinguishable at all. It really didn't even taste like there was any in there. I've tried nearly every coffee place's latte in the Tempe and Scottsdale area, so I have a fair idea of what is good and what is not. Again, very disappointing, especially since the menu looked so promising. And the kicker to all this is the peach pie had no flavor, no life, nothing. It tasted like a frozen pie that had been defrosted and was sitting out for hours. This supposedly being a made from scratch pastry! Oh, and the barista forgot to even bring it to us, immediately after we ordered it. We had to remind her. 

The people were fairly nice, and the space was inviting, which saves this place from being a one star in my book. But I know we will certainly not be back. That's a shame, because with the location, layout, and interesting drink selections, this place has potential. Right now though, it just seems all for show. A good artifice with no substance.",1,1,1,review

I like the location, and it is a great place for studying, with lots of tables and outlets. I had been there a few times before and always had great service (one of the baristas, Emily, always gives good recommendations) but on my last visit, one of the male baristas was very rude and condescending.

They make their perfectly-piped pastries and almond macadamia nut milk in-house... That's just how I had to start this review.

But seriously, this place is a winner. The set-up is unlike any other coffee shop. It's open but you find yourself in your own world once you sit down. During our first visit, my boyfriend and I ordered a chai and banana bread. The chai was a 4/5 but the banana bread was so good, we went to order another one. The girl at the counter gave us another banana bread for half off and threw in a coffee cake for FREE... just because!

I've gotten a few lattes and drip coffees since, and they've all been pretty tasty! This is the spot for you if you're in your twenties, looking for a comforting baked good, need your coffee in a rush, or need a place to work/study. We probably come here twice a week now.

The coffee and pastry bar sits in a corner far from the entrance doors.  Owners/management: please put up better menu signs to allow first-timers and those who do not know what's available to choose, instead of feeling pressured to order something fast at the cash register- the menu was on plaques placed right in front of the register.  There were a few pastries on display, but the ones that caught my attention were on one of the guest tables.  Looked like bruschetta, but with nutella and chunky nuts.  Apparently, these were being tested for an upcoming breakfast offering.

I liked the cold brew tasting-- four cold brews of your choosing, for $6.  You then get to choose a 12 oz. pour of cold brew, or opt for any pastry/dessert from the case.  I chose Ethiopian, Apple Jack, Blackberry-Lavender, and Coconut.  Funny how the two I thought I'd enjoy the most (the last two) would be my least favorites!  I'd definitely order the Ethiopian cold brew again, and perhaps the Apple Jack with cream.  The blackberry-lavender was too tart, and I could only detect the berry, which was unfortunate, since I love lavender-scented anything: chocolates/truffles, ice creams/gelatos, shortbreads, soaps, and lotions, etc.  The house-made tiramisu was just OK.  Actually, I didn't eat much of it at the time, since I already had enough milk fat and sugar from the salted creme brûlée coffee here, and I ended up throwing away the leftovers at home that night, since most of the takeaway cup was filled with waxy cream filling.  The female rep here told the new guy that he must stress that everything here is made in-house, from the cold brews steeped with herbs, spices, and fruits the night before, to the hazelnut-chocolate spread and the caramel syrup and melted chocolate used in coffees.  

I wished I'd gone with the huge chocolate chip cookie with the house-made hazelnut-chocolate spread, instead of the tiramisu...  I may come back for a second visit, but not before I check out all the other coffee shops I've bookmarked for years.

This time I got the berry iced coffee. It was $4 for large iced coffee. Again, not worth it. I'm not sure what it is supposed to taste like, but it tasted burnt and very acidic to me. Not good. Because I really wanted to like this place, I went one last time. Again, small iced soy latte. Tasted like watered down milk. It had no smooth coffee or even soy milk taste! Just like water.

The coffee there is fine, but it's always kind of a weird, tense shitshow in there. I was glad to see that the baristas in Hazelrock were not fronting the  typical coffee-chain overhyped, aggressively sunny demeanor and just spoke like real humans. Thank you.

The interior is spacious, open, and extremely clean and polished. Great care was taken to design the menu boards and they're packed with information about their proprietary beans: tasting notes, production information, growing regions (today it was Brazil, Ethiopia and Cameroon). I personally was thrilled to see this, and excited about the prospect of choosing a bean (I went with the Ethiopian).

After ordering, I waited a few minutes and was given an iced coffee when I had wanted hot. The barista was apologetic and mentioned that she ""just assumed"" and I admitted that I didn't specify, either. However, I do think that if you don't specify, it should be hot. Isn't that the default? At any rate, I just ended up going with the iced coffee since I was in a hurry (and anyone who knows iced coffee knows that Ethiopian beans are the best for iced anyway.) No big deal. The coffee itself was great, by the way. Bright, vibrant notes, smooth and intense. Yes. 

When it comes down to it, all the high-concept, coffee-as-the-new-wine, making-the-gourmet-the-norm is essential, and there is a market for it, and it's necessary to raise the bar and lift us from the depths of the bottom of Einstein's brown-stained coffee urn, but you also have to be able to take orders, and make drinks fast and not have your baristas short circuit and blow up when someone orders ""just a decaf, please"". I think the real mark of excellence in coffee comes from a certain subtlety: exceptional coffee that doesn't need to be dressed up and called out by a long list of pseudo-Italian terms. Good coffee can be served black, as-is, and stand on its own. And no matter how you market it, if it's a good roast, people will notice.",1,0,1,review

I'm convinced Ina was thinking of the Ferrero Rocher cookie when she said this because this cookie....it is the real deal. Perfectly chocolatey, crunch and indulgent, this signature treat of Hazelrock's can easily be shared, but you probably won't want to.

The pastry case is a first come first serve situation, so once they are out of something, typically they are out of it for the day. Except for the Ferrero Rocher cookie. I've never not seen it in the case and I think its popularity demands that it's in the case at all times. I've also had the coffee cake which was an excellent, not too crumbly, not overly sweet pairing with our beverages. I really liked the Royal Tea latte that I had recently and it made a nice after dinner beverage.

On my second visit, I came with a friend. I ordered a latte (they don't do flavoured lattes and it's weird that the employee didn't suggest the salted brúlée latte that several people seem to be raving about in the reviews). The latte was OK. I think if you're a coffee person you might appreciate it more. My friend got a hot chocolate with cow's milk and he thought it was watery even thou it was made with whole milk. We also tried some of the sweets: the chocolate banana tart and the ferrero rocher cookie. I don't recommend eating any of these by yourself. Make sure you share it because they are hella sweet. Not a bad thing necessarily if that's what you like. The banana chocolate tart was delicious. It has real pieces of banana in there. No laffy taffy, artificial banana flavour. I enjoyed it. The cookie is a chocolate chip cookie with nutella and hazelnuts on top. Obviously it's delicious. On my third visit, I got an iced tea. I believe it was a berry black tea. I added a couple teaspoons of sugar to it and it was good. 

I haven't been wowed by any drink from this place so I give them 1 star for that. 
The two sweets that I've tried were both very good so I give them + 2 stars. That brings them to a 3 out of 5. I'm not keen to give another star for service because the employees always seem clueless about what they have. Anytime there is a girl at the register she has to ask the guy who makes the drinks what milk they have or what is in a particular drink. You should know what's in your product. Owner needs to train consistently.  

I'd only go back to try the other sweets but I won't go out of my way to visit.",1,1,0,review

Got a latte and a cold brew the times I visited and got the Ferrero Rocher cookie per Yelp's recommendations and thoroughly enjoyed it. The latte definitely gives you that kick of caffeine and the staff is always willing to answer any questions you may have. They do have a cool variety of cold brews where do steep certain ingredients i.e. cinnamon or coconut to infuse flavors and did their best to answer their methods and so on. The Ferrero Rocher cookie is for those with a killer sweet tooth! It's a soft, chewy chocolate chip cookie topped with Nutella and chopped hazelnuts ... what? I know! It's amazing.

The wi-fi is fast, there's tons of seating for groups, pairs or for the lone person. Interior is well lit, good amount of outlets and natural lighting from the windows and artificial ones over head.

PROS: Just about everything. Plenty of space, plenty of seating, plenty of *comfortable* seating, always bright and clean, a growing calendar of events (including, as I found out by accident the other night, magic shows!), a polite staff, a decent menu. Hazelrock quickly became an almost-daily go-to for me. I absolutely love the atmosphere. REALLY great place for hanging out, playing board games, studying - whatever. Good place for groups, good place for individuals. You really can't go wrong with this one.

CONS: Only one minor con, and I blame this on my snobbiness when it comes to coffee. I've noticed a pretty conspicuous inconsistency in product quality. Not sure what to attribute this to, but the fact is, Hazelrock has a lot to compete against in this area. If they can take just that *little* bit of extra pride in how their coffee is prepared, it would up my review from four stars to five.

CONCLUSION: All in all, a great addition to the budding coffee economy. Not the best coffee in the area (yet - they're still young!), but definitely one of the better locations and settings in the area. A very nice craft addition to an otherwise college area. If you haven't been, it's worth a go. You'll likely find yourself visiting often.

Stumbled randomly into this cafe / coffee / bakery on a Saturday afternoon. Originally wanted an iced mocha but the sweets looked soooo good. Couldn't help myself!

Let's get the drink review out of the way first. Cuz I'm more of a dessert person anyway. Iced mocha was great. Light and refreshing. The manager said that the mocha had real shredded chocolate on it- nice touch!

Now. The baked goods! Mmmmmm. Tried the Ferrero cookie, chocolate banana tart, white chocolate macadamia cookie, and mango flavored shaved ice (is that a thing here?). Come with a group- these treats are pretty big but shareable so it was awesome that I could taste multiple things. My favorite is the Ferrero cookie (AMAZING. Great chocolate and nutty flavor. Soft and decadent) but all of them were pretty great.

Space is really big. Lots of tables and seating. Decor is kinda hipster/rustic look. They need to add some art though on the walls to spruce the place up.

The manager and staff were very friendly.

However, Clifton Fish Bar was last year fined for poor hygiene during a standard hygiene test. On hearing this news, I felt a bit sick that I had actually eaten there as the test had found dead mice and mice droppings in the shop.
However, it must be noted that subsequent to this, the shop has cleaned its act up and although the owner says that he was not aware of any mouse problem, he has put in measures to make sure that such an issue will not arise in the future.

I've long heard this place was THE place to see and be seen in Scottsdale. I knew that wasn't true and had no plans ever to go there. But a birthday party for a fine young man fueled my trip on a Saturday night.

Thankfully, we arrived shortly before 10 p.m. --- ahead of many of the plastic millionaires and their shiny chariots. Being the lame, tongue and knuckle dragging fools we are, of course, men had to shell out $10 while women were spared. Once inside, we could see where it was all heading.

It's an older crowd at Barcelona than, say, whatever club on Mill Avenue in Tempe. But that's not to say they are grown-ups. In fact, it is a lot more like high school than anything else. The uncool cool people prance around while spiced up oldies make communicating with anything other than hand gestures and swirling hips worthless. The black-suited security guards talking into their sleeves every few seconds also offer a real --- if not short-lived and ultimately comical --- feel that this place is actually hip. 

In a word: Underwhelming.

Make no mistake about it, though, Barcelona is beautifully appointed. Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them. The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona. Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service. And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded.

I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English. She writes/compliments me... I'm cocky/funny. I offer to explore downtown with her. She turns me down. I try the next girl. Same result. But the intent is always there. After this review, I doubt I'll have to worry about succeeding with any woman who ever reads this review ever again. 

So check it out. I'm a male slut. If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter. That's my M.O. It works. If it ain't broke... 

I'm not altogether proud of the man I've become but I'm not going to stop either. From what I've gathered from movies and television, my life is fairly wonderful. Unless me writing about it causes some cosmic/karmic shift and I get disfigured in a car accident tomorrow and lose my mojo, I have several strong years of carousing left in me.  

Ok, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the ""cougars"" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a ""cougar"" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks. Guess how many woman we've taken home or who have taken us to their homes in the last two weeks? Four. Guess how many we've given The Business to... The same four. Guess what our batting average is... .1000

Usually, I need to take a woman out one more time before The Business is exchanged. Sometimes more if she's particularly prudish. Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency. I like The Business. So if you're reading this and you think I'm scum, I used to be you. I've ""evolved."" If you're reading this and you're a woman who knows what she wants, shoot me a message. And if you're reading this you think I'm lying because you didn't get laid last time you went there, I am willing to show you how. But you'd never take my advice because you don't believe me or think you'll succeed next time on your own or think I'm an ass for writing this and you don't want to meet me on principle.

I have often wondered if every bar has too many men, there must be one place where all of the women go. Where is that place? That question was once rhetorical. It turns out, in Scottsdale, Arizona, that place is Barcelona's. 

We were seated early in the section that is cleared out to make way for a dance floor as later in the night Zooey Boey takes the stage. We started with a few appetizers, of which my clear favorite was the macadamia nut encrusted shrimp; they were incredibly good (I do not even like macadamia nuts). The portions were more than generous for each person at the table. I had the bone-in-ribeye which came with a Bearnaise sauce on the side that was very good. They serve a molten chocolate desert that was heavenly on a soft bed of ice cream. We all left extremely full and even more satisfied with the meal.

Given it being a Thursday, the place was packed.  Best way to describe this place is amazing Spanish decor on a large scale.  The outdoor patio is perfect for warm days/nights and the interior is typical of Scottsdale architecture: new, modern with airplane hanger height ceilings and furnished with beautiful furniture and warm tones.

Dare I say it?  It's actually better than places in S.F.  *sniff*

I expected country bumpkins (Sorry!  My first time in Phoenix.  Had to trudge over for work.) but found a Laguna Beach/Costa Mesa atmosphere (sans the ocean) in the middle of the desert.

The crowd's friendly, male-to-female ratio balanced and we even snagged some boxing tickets from a nice guy walking around.  Does it get any better than that?

I heard Brittany and Jess head to this place when they're in town...but you may/may not want to disclose that info.

The only drawback to the Scottsdale/Phoenix scene is the distance between one venue to the next.

It is spacious, so for all the claustrophobic people out there, you'll definitely not feel like a sardine in a tin can.

Caution, for cougar lovers, there are a lot prowling around, waiting to sink their claws in young meat. I've never had the opportunity to eat there, so I can't say anything in regards to food.

What can't I say about this place that hasn't been said before?

Food:  they have a new chef, so apparently they heard others talking badly about the food.  I actually really enjoyed the food and our server was awesome.  Ridiculously expensive?  Yes.  Good to my tum?  Definitely.  We decided to try a little of everything so in our menu was the Seared Ahi, Chopped salad with bacon dates, Tenderloin empanadas, Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, and sweet potato fries.

Ahi was seared perfectly.  It had a slightly spicey musky sauce with it.  Very yum unless you don't like raw-ish fish.  Bacon dates are my new favorite.  Mmmm.  Empanadas were good, but you didn't really get much of a meat flavor.  Caprese was wonderfully fresh.  Sweet potato fries....god yes.

Price per dish around $9 to $14.  You're looking at about $25 for an entree.  Drinks were relatively decent in price...but $12 for a glass of wine.  My favorite Reisling is $12 per bottle, for crying out loud.

This place is AWESOME for people watching.  Young things with massive...melons of flesh, meat-head men trying to look cool, 50+ women trying to outdo the young things, and 50+ men ogling everyone creepily.

The singers on stage were quite cheesy.  Great choice in music, but I'd much rather listen to the DJ version than a upscale karaoke.  No dude, you're NOT bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt.  And whoa...the female singer...honey, you need someone else to do your extentions.

Wierd mix of dress code:  from prom date to stained t-shirts.  Ugh.

$9 for a pack of cigs (I don't smoke, but I heard) and you can order a drink in the bathroom.  Wha?  So you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room?

A lovely young woman of my recent acquaintance invited me here recently for the purpose of attending a birthday party for a friend of hers. Neither of us would have come here otherwise. 

If you're thinking about going, don't do it. If you care for the deets, read on. If not, stop reading here and.... go somewhere else. Please. 

We show up at about 8 for drinks and dinner. I wasn't in a drinking mood, my date's Appletini was pretty Appley but the amount of liquor was tini. Must be why they call it an Appletini. Hm. Highlight was the bread brought to the table - the pretzel rolls were the highlight of the evening. How sad is that?

Now... the place is called Barcelona. Barcelona is a city in Spain. THe closest thing to a Spanish dish on the menu us Paella, otherwise it's a steakhouse menu with a few obligatory pasta dishes. Totally uninspired.

I ordered the ribeye, medium rare. It came out medium, and the glaze and whatever else they put on it were awful, save the two onion rings. I doubt this was USDA prime beef. It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating. The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato. 

My date had some kind of pasta with shrimp dish. The shrimp were overdone, the pasta was, ok. Denny's pasta is OK, too, and let's face it, so is Chef Boyardee... So don't read too much into the complement. 

Barcelona. Spain. The place doesn't look that Spanish on the inside. There is a giant mural on the ceiling, dim lights, it reminds me more of Las Vegas cheese than Spain. 

While you dine, there are two Scottsdouche (or is it Douchedale?) types crooning back and forth to each other on stage. Is this where failed American Idol contestants try to relive their moment of glory? I don't know. They made a reappearance later, singing along with a DJ to a selection of bad 90's pop music with the occasional 80's party jam. 

The crowd is douchey. The food is awful and on the pricey side. The service, spotty. 

If you're coming for the thing Barcelona is famous for, you'll find a lot of it. If not, stay away. Far, far away.",5,5,4,review

2.  BBQ - If you're sitting outside on the patio, prepare to smell like BBQ chicken after you are done.  I don't know who designed this, but it was pretty poor engineering.  You don't build a BBQ in the middle of the lounge, so that your patrons get smoke in their faces.

3.  Fancy Cars - Sure I love Ferrari's just as much as the next guy, but the fact that they put them in the front is sort of lame....like they're trying too hard to make themselves look uber-cool.

It actually is a restaurant, too. The food is Ok. The Paella is huge and not bad. They try real hard to make this place the chi-chi joint for the hip resort/snowbird crowd. It is huge, with several dining areas and bars, a large patio, and a small stage and decent dance floor. They usually have live music on the weekends and intersperse with Disco DJs. On weekends you have cowgirls walking around with their ""shooters"" holsters and shot glasses thru the 4 bars. A lot of the waitresses (not just here, but in most of Snotsdale's higher end joints) are part time ASU coeds trying to make a buck to buy more short skirts and halter tops at the mall. 

Everyone at night is pretty much trying to create an impression beyond their true reality, whether it is the young diggers or the old farts. If you are from Dallas or Calgary, you will probably like this place for its unapologetic panash for conspicouus consumption.

I had gotten a $20 day pass,  and had a pretty good time by the pool with my friend.    At a time, there had been some porn stars frolicking in the water, they were making hamburgers (the staff, not the porn stars),  and the place had a sort of 80's, West Hollywood-camp charm.

Recently I headed to a trade show in Vegas, and for the first time my hotel room wasn't being paid for by my job, so I decided to try out the Blue Moon.

PROS:  

For me, I like that it's off the strip. (Less traffic, not as many obnoxious tourists, etc.)  Also the biggest selling point for me is your proximity to your car.   (you are definitely going to want to rent a car if you stay here, in my opinion)  I absolutely hate the self parking rigamaroo  and subsequent trek through throngs of casino-goers and  miles a dreary, carpeted passageways just to get to your room that is the norm at most of the big hotels.   here you just open your car door and step inside.   it's an old TravelLodge,  so you get the idea of the setup.

Since it is a gay-owned and operated business, there are a few feel-good points awarded for staying here, and supporting the community.   stuff is generally very nice and the owner is attentive, and seems to get what people want.

There is a nice breakfast spread in the morning including  2-hour coffee, which is a bonus.

There is a steam room and  kind of seedy  porn watching area,  if you're into that.

CONS:   

Don't go there expecting to meet a porn star.   I'm sure it happens, but this isn't the cast's quarters for Chippendale's, lol.  

If you want to have guests at the hotel, you sort of have to go  down and let them in at night.   not a big deal, and it makes sense from a security standpoint, but is not as freewheeling as some other places.

If you are used to staying at the Bellagio,  and need to park next to a Bentley  to get yourself through the day,  skip this place.   as I said, it is campy and fun,  not glamorous or chic.   but at the end of the day, ask yourself... what is Vegas really all about?",8,6,4,review

So, we did.  Our first time.  Thankfully, we paid the Sunday night rate and we got that value.  The place as a whole is a little rough around the edges.  Other guests we talked to love the place and return.  We probably wouldn't.  It's the little things: no luggage rack for suitcase, no towel bars for bath towels (install a couple of hooks?), exposed wires on the walls (and extra bunched on the floor) for accent lighting, a foaming soap dispenser at sink and shower (really?  like a truck stop? I'm all for conserving on little bottles and soap bars - install a three-way liquid soap dispenser and that way you can also offer your guests shampoo and conditioner - which they don't now.  $16).  The back stairs that lead to the pool over look areas of junk.  Trash by the pool equipment etc.  So easy to just throw that stuff away.  It's in plain sight of guests and just adds to the attitude of general lack of care.  So, picky?  Well, maybe.  But, these very simple little things are what sets apart hotels and makes for a guest wanting to return.

Now, the good stuff:  the Sunday pool party was very busy and fun.  Maybe 40 men (mostly au natural) sunning and frolicking.  Guests seemed to have a great time (bring your own cooler).  Breakfast was really excellent (a big pleasant surprise!).  Bed very comfortable and linens all nicely clean.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Free WiFi worked well in the rooms.  Large steam room was nice.  Video room was popular.  And, with the day pass system, you get to mingle with some local boys, too.

So, for the gay boys who like to roll with the boys, have a great time!  We'll pass next time.  But, then, we live in Palm Springs and get plenty of gay all the time.  For others not in that position, they'll have a different perspective.",8,3,2,review

For those of you used to lots of luxury - this is not your place to go.  I am a bit spoiled - but I appreciated the slow pace and the men's only atmosphere. 

I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and the slow pace.  

There are only a few things I would ask that they do.

1) have each room set up with a book that details the locations and areas of the different things for the hotel.

2) there needs to be an monthly updated calander in the each room

3) there needs to be a better list of gay clubs and venues as well as the times and locations,.

4)Towels need to be replaced and all the lights in the rooms need to work.

5) The coffee in the rooms needs to be free.  2 bucks for in room coffee is a pain in the butt.  Raise the room rates a smidge to help cover it. 

This in an older hotel and I understand that - for those of you who can,..get a suite on the pool side of the hotel.  It cuts down on noise.  You can also peek at your car in the lot.

Pros:  staff is awesome, including John the owner.  It is clothing optional, so if you want to lay out by the pool sans Speedo, you can. The pool area and hot tub is nice. Fun when there is a group staying there or sunday bbq pool parties. Continental breakfast is free and pretty decent.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  It's quiet.  If you want to cruise, that option is available to you. Free parking close to your room. Very happy to let me do a late check out and then hang around the pool the rest of the day until my late afternoon flight.

Cons:  they are 5 minutes off the strip.  Absolutely no biggy though--it's a quick car ride or cab ride to the strip.  There is nothing within walking distance for food or anything to do (sketchy industrial-ish neighborhood), but again- a quick hop to the strip.
The price is high relative to what you can get for a nicer strip hotel--but, if you want to stay at a clothing optional resort with other gay folks, that's what you are paying for.  The room I had wasn't fabulous---the TV was like 14"".  C'mon guys, you can get a 42"" for $250. A lot of it is in the details though--there was a light out in the bathroom.  The shower head sprayed water all over the place.  The elevator light is one exposed light.  There is ""junk"" off the pool area that you can see if you go out the end exits.  Kind of looks like the money was put in up front in the rooms and then nothing much has been updated since then.  It was a bit of a ghost town, even with Hustlaball in town (I had hoped there would be an afterparty like there was 5 years ago (which i missed!)).

2xICJxlUS5O6ruN-A993tA,asoMD67RegPXt1FUSRdz5Q,8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ,2,2014-02-28,"I've been going to the Blue Moon for various events, from early Banana Hammock Sundays to Tuesday night socials and Sunday BBQ's.  I've also stayed here a couple of times before my last stay.  The other reviews are right on the money about the owner and the staff.  John Hessling clearly understands customer service. It is the reason why I booked a stay there a few days while the moving truck where I was relocating from was en route to Vegas.

There is also an unnecessary snarky side to the operation and seems to prevail staff-wide. Asking for extra towels or to let a guest's visitor into the property within a reasonable amount of time (was my brother-in-law, not a trick), is not an extraordinary request.  I can understand why one would feel bothered if the room was comped.  But it wasn't. I think the owner and staff have lost sight of the fact that guests are choosing to stay there rather than the Wynn (where it was cheaper for the time of my stay at Blue Moon).  When inquiring about certain clubs, I was told by the staff at the front desk they weren't allowed to promote some of them and were directed to send me to certain venues. Not illegal, nor a surprise. But pretty crappy way to deny a guest an experience.

Mr. Hessling also has a blog where he pens somewhat bitchy copy under the name PERSON OF INTEREST and runs a hook-up app called Bent, which, though I indulge in both, is probably hurting his attention to the details at the Blue Moon.   Sadly, it is unlikely I will come back here, nor recommend it, until it gets back into the the tip-top shape it once was--and can be again.

As for the neighborhood, this is all subjective. No one has ever been mugged, murdered, accosted (unwillingly, at least) in the area.  Hessling does put a premium on security, and for that, I have to give him credit.",0,0,0,review

Be aware that the day pass is only good until 8pm, then light's out honey, on your way home if you are visiting without having a room there.  

They do have a very nice pool with a waterfall shower, and privatized (walled-in jacuzzi).  It is clothing optional, so try to be nice to those who are over-endowed :)

Also, to be fair, the whole place looked clean.  

Finally, decor and music are totally gay chic, good for him. 

To be fair, I didn't stay in the hotel part, so you'll have to check for yourself on their quality.  Hopefully that matches the price. 

Okay now the cons.  First it is really hard to find if you're not local.  Cab drivers haven't heard of it so bring the mapquest with you. 

David is kind of a jaded indifferent queen in my opinion.  Okay to be fair, yes it takes one to know one.  But he did something no retail queen should.  I asked him where the towels were and he said oh by the blue tins at the pool - of course when I get over there all the towels in the bin are - you guessed it...WET. 

Okay, could happen, he could be busy while supplies don't last, but then he got all huffy about having to get me a clean one.  

Also, David, honey really do SOMETHING to upgrade that locker ""room"".  It looks like it should star in a scene of ""OZ"" - the one about the prison .

Also, he has that cell phone plastered to his ear.  And not the incoming calls asking questions about the place either.  I really don't like it when retail queens make waiting paying customers seem like we are interrupting their hot gossip session when they are behind the counter. 

I know, he and others will say - it's  his place, he can run it the way he wants.  Well, attitude can be everything, and he needs to work on his.  We do keep him in business.  After leaving the interactions with him I only felt slightly welcome to come back, us customers can be SUCH a nuisance when he is trying to have a juicy cell phone conversation.   

It's nice that he provides internet, although it's screaming slow to load, and definitely not Comcastic.  

Finally, if you plan a massage, they are by appointment, so schedule ahead, their massage guy is really hit and miss.",14,12,4,review

I was there in early March, so it wasn't ""in season"", but the pool, waterfall and jacuzzi were available.  I think the rooms are terrific, mine had a huge flatscreen, separate sound system, couches, chairs and a bathroom that was brightly lit (hard to find in any hotel).  I had a fridge and bar sink in the main living area, a huge walk in closet and windows that actually opened.

You do need to depend on cabs or a car, but there is free parking, steps from the entrance, not like the half mile long jaunts from the parking lots of the large strip hotels.  While the area is mostly industrial, there are several other properties within half a block.  I never felt unsafe.

John, one of the owners, was on the property almost every day and couldn't have been nicer.  

If you're looking for cruising, you'll find it.  If you're not, you'll have a pleasant stay in a unique property with a friendly stay who will go out of their way for you.

The decor is sketchy, to say the least.  When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.

Not the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.

The food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.

  Given a table and a chilled bottle of water I got started.. Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice, watermelon, sauces/dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.

  As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl... 

  The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability...

My kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  

I asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.

The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal.

Yelp hasn't led me wrong yet...but anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out! When I suggested it he said yea sounds good.  That right their gave him some points, cuz it's normally my girlfriends that I talk into going with me to try new ethnic cuisines.

So got their around 6:30pm, Date looked cute & fly! We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything. The place is very cute on the inside; I think we were early, because we had decided on trying out the dinner buffet to try a little bit of everything, and the owner asked us to give him a few mins to get all the serving spoons out. No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,  then owner said its ready! Oh yea baby I was starving and ready to go!

I tried a cauliflower dish, don't know what it was called but god it was good! Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat, but not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I then spotted the butter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone! Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect! It was a good night!

Also side note, my date tried the goat biryani and thought it to be spicy and told the owner, who tried it and said yea it's on the spicy side, will make up a new batch right now, now to me that's excellent service!

Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor, green sauce with spinach.  We also ordered Poori bread, which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at.  Since it was fried, the kids loved the crunchy top.  Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor, red sauce with lots of good spice.  The food is a little spicy, but we like spicy!  One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.

Also had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.

The floor of the restaurant had stuff strewn all over- a turn off when you're there to eat, and fail to see how they couldn't have the waitstaff sweep the place in less than 10 mins.  There was only 1 other family dining, so clearly they weren't swamped.  
There were many dishes which included South Indian and North India.  The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting butter paneer.  The chicken dishes were average to below average.  The dessert was horrible - runny mango custard, tasteless fried sweet bread.

There was zero ambience.  It was very 'store like'. I wish all the restaurants around could take a cue or two from 'Chutneys' in Tempe.  They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices.  Their flavors are unmatched.

Cons:
a. The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt . Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt.  I heard another person complain as well when I entered.. So am not alone.
b. When this restaurant had a different owner , I thought I saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and we didn't try it anyways. Interestingly , there was no music either ..
c. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present.
d. When we entered , the Naan tray was empty. When I tried twice later on, they were empty. When I left , they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said it was good.
c. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice.
d. What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet?
e. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent.
f. I thought the menu said vegetable biryani. I only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani.
g. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better.
h. I wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.

You get the idea.  We left to get some coffee and returned about a half hour later to find 3-4 more vendors.  There was a honey vendor, hummus, cookies, produce, a couple sandwich places, flowers...and the one place with produce.

(And I'm not one of the people comparing it to how it was in the 70s either - I am a 21 year old college student that thinks it is yuck.)

Mill Avenue is not the hype people give it. It is disgusting. It's dirty and grimy (and not just because it's old). There are homeless drug addicts everywhere you turn, that will harrass you if you don't give them change, and scare the crap out of me when I have to walk past. I will NOT walk down Mill after dark alone. 

Full of wasted college kids here every weekend night of course, and it is a terrible atmosphere if you're not 21-24 looking to get hammered and lucky.

Good luck finding parking, it's all metered, expensive garages, or free 3 blocks away at Farmer and 5th, but that's usually full of students' cars.

EDIT: No more free parking, ANYWHERE! 5th and Farmer is now ""Permit Only"" until 6 pm. So if you want to get lunch or hit happy hour, you are SOL on parking. Gee, Mill Avenue, guess you really must not be doing well, that you have to take more and more free parking away every few months.

The stores are all corporate garbage, except for Old Town Books, Hippie Gypsy and a couple independent (at least I think) restaurants/bars. How exactly is a giant PF Changs, Urban Outfitters, and Starbucks conducive to ""local flavor""? The rent in the area is outrageous, hence why the mom-and-pops can't stay in business.

And if I didn't hate Mill Avenue enough, the fact that they had a cute mom-and-pop ice cream sandwich store (Cookiez) and then allowed ""Slickables"", a big honking backed-by-tons-of-money store selling the EXACT SAME PRODUCT with Dreyers ice cream to move in across the street. That was just in poor taste, especially since Cookiez is now out of business.

Don't be fooled by the ""historical buildings"" on the street, as a number of them are over a century old, but quite a few were built architecturally designed to look old. I can appreciate the aesthetic value of it, just as I can appreciate the attempt to make a walkable neighborhood. Unfortunately, only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable: the majority of visitors have to drive to get here (not good for a bar-hopping/drinking-and-driving destination) and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car, unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS.

I'm gonna have to be brutally honest with you, Mill Avenue is not the coolest place in Tempe.  In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.

Today, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't ""District"" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an ""arts district"" a ""shopping district"" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the ""Mill Avenue District"" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.

Mill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).

However, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.

Mill Ave has a different feel then most places you go. It's a nice area for a walk, lunch and window shopping. There's a variety of places to eat and some offer patio seating. Great way to relax and people watch.

Mill Ave seems like a fun place to hang out when you get bored, and it is, mostly.
I really don't like the police force out there (are any of them good in the Valley?), they are way too in your business which they should be for disruptive or drunk people, but not really for those of us who are clearly not doing anything wrong. If I am sitting on a bench on Mill Avenue that does not imply that I am also a drunk underage drug dealer as well.
However there are many disruptive people on Mill Avenue, and it seems that the cops are less worried with those who are actually committing crimes. I mean I am a firm believer in the saying ""two each his own"", do what you gotta do to be happy. I am not easily bothered but when I walk down a street and see a man peeing in the open, a man vomiting in a bush, a group of guys in speedos, and a group of girls in lacy bras within five minutes, I am a bit irritated. Especially because more than a few cops passed by and my friends and I are the only ones who look suspicious.
There are also the countless creepers you can find on Mill Ave. I am not talking about the homeless, they are actually quite easy to get along with around there. I am referring to the guys that basically harass everyone of the female gender that walks by.

It's been a while, I thought, and many of the corporate chains that ruined the street are fleeing as fast as their trucks can carry them off. It's worth a shot. 

I attempted to park in front of the now-vacant Z-Gallerie, only to find that meters had been installed. Of course, nobody carries change nowadays, so I followed the blue sign that read ""Public Parking"" and wound up in the virtually empty parking garage. I spent less than an hour on the street, and when I was leaving the business I'd come to visit, I asked about having my parking pass validated. ""We don't do that any more,"" I was told. ""They took our equipment. Anyway, the first hour's free."" Back at the parking garage, I was surprised when the attendant in the booth, without a word of greeting, said flatly, ""Two dollar."" ""Two dollars?"" I asked him, explaining that the first hour was free, at least according to a business owner on the street. ""Two dollar,"" he said again. I had no cash, and told him so. ""Two dollar. Two dollar,"" said the parrot in his little cage. I asked him where I could get cash on the street and he said, exasperated, ""Is two dollar!""

I backed up (unsurprisingly there was nobody behind me), parked, and, already running late for an appointment, walked to the kiosk at Bank of America, was asked for spare change by a kid lounging on the sidewalk, crossed the street, re-entered the parking garage, drove up to the booth, and again presented my parking pass to the attendant, who now said, without irony, ""Three dollar."" Evidently it cost another dollar to walk across the street to pay the already extortionate sum of two dollars. Wordlessly I handed him a twenty and, ignoring the faint smile on his lips, left Mill Avenue, this time for good. 

The last time I visited Mill (more than a year ago), I received a $40 parking ticket after having lingered too long in Borders -- another business that I see has pulled up stakes and fled for a more profitable street. At the time, though, Mill Avenue was bustling. People wanted to be there. Yesterday the street was virtually abandoned, the storefronts mostly empty, the few people I encountered seemingly killing time between classes at ASU. In short, it was devoid of life. And for this they charge to park? For this they make things as difficult as possible, both for visitors and for the businesses nobody wants to visit anymore? And why would they, when they can visit the same chain stores selling the same items in any mall in America? But as usual, it's the independent businesses who suffer -- the ones who were forced out during the first wave of Mill Avenue's corporate takeover, and the ones there now, who are fighting for their lives.

What they've done to this once-charming street is a travesty.",4,3,3,review

Because the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable, Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12. Previously, Mill was barricaded off, you had to pay to enter, and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars. At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance. 

Now that Tempe has taken over, the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks. Now, while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture, in the case of the Fiesta Bowl, an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals, where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status, they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally. The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year. 

Honestly, I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole. It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks. There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual), and all the while, the only ""entertainment"" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money.

There are so many different type of stores throughout these street that meet a variety of needs.   There is a store called ""Hippie Gypsy"" that has tons of unique items you would think a hippy would use, but it is overall just a fun store.  There is all kinds of ice cream places, restaurants, bars, clubs, convenient stores,  high-end clothing stores, boutiques, and even a piano bar.

Mill Avenue was once a place of tattoo parlors and biker bars. Then it got cleaned up and improved. It was then really nice.

Did Tempe change the zoning to allow the open air loud music multi-screen scuzzy beer dives that now line the street? I can't imagine even drunk college kids thinking that these places are fun or interesting. Maybe I'm wrong, there were lots of drunks there--but not sure if they were college kids or bikers.

Just walking up and down today I counted 3 tattoo parlors and one tattoo removal place across the street.

I had a Thai Coconut infused seafood soup. It came quickly, was nice and hot and had a nice balance of flavour. This is at the core of Thai food, that blend of tastes with the lemon grass assertively tweaking the mix.

It's very obvious that this place is Chinese run, given that they don't realize how funny their name can be, and that they have many Chinese dishes on their menu. Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.

We ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.

Red Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.

Phad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. 

Basil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.

Tamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.

Their prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp.

Don't be fooled by other cheap Groupon deals with inexperienced, impatient or uninterested stylists who just want to do a crappy job to get you in and out. Lets face it...doing lashes is a very meticulous and precise time consuming job that requires patience and skill, and Jessica has it nailed.

We ordered a steak, a prosciutto with melon platter, caprese salad, and a calamari. The calamari tasted phenomenal, as did the prosciutto. The steak was covered in gravy sauce, but the steak itself was not as good in flavor nor texture.
 ""Dinner for two"", which also included a soda, bottle of water, a tiramisu and cappuccino costed 72€, plus my voluntary tip. I probably wouldn't have tipped if I knew what was about to happen. (I always tip generously at restaurants, except when the waitstaff treats us cheaply.)
We overall enjoyed our experience at the table as a group until the end when the waiter tried to charge one of the couples in our group for additional items which they did not order. It seems as if somebody else's meal had not been paid and our friends were being pressured to pay it. During the meal, we were pleased and everyone thought it was a good place for special dinners, but after the problem with the check, we all changed our minds. 
The waiter had the audacity to tell one of the ladies in our group that paying it would not make you poor. 
He's right, but we're also not stupid. What an insult. So from a 4.5 star experience, with the 1 star treatment in the end, they get a very generous 3-star. (Only a sincere apology from the owner to our group would change my rating to 4.)",5,0,0,review

Die guten Bewertungen im Internet, welche das Restaurant als bestes in Sindelfingen darstellen, sind teilweise Gefälligkeitsbewertungen, wie sich schon am Schreibstil leicht feststellen läßt. Zudem sind 25 Bewertungen von Personen, welche nur eine einzige Bewertung veröffentlich haben.
Doch der Reihe nach:
1. Besuch- Weihnachtsfeier unserer Firma- (ca. 25 Personen). Personal und Küche total überfordert. Getränke liefern funktionierte sehr schleppend und bis das letzte Essen kam, waren über 3 Stunden vergangen. Während sich ein Teil der Kollegen unten auf der Kegelbahn vergnügte, saßen andere da und warteten und warteten und warteten. Dabei war angekündigt, daß wir nach dem Essen gemeinsam die Kegelbahn nutzen wollen.
2.Besuch- abends mit 3 Personen- Gaststätte relativ leer, dadurch Bedienung in akzeptabler Zeit, allerdings das Essen nicht übermäßig üppig. Da ich meine Frau und einen Bekannten eingeladen hatte, empfahl ich eben noch einen Nachtisch zu nehmen. Jetzt zeigte sich etwas, was in anderen Bewertungen im Internet schon sehr häufig beschrieben wurde, die familiäre Atmosphäre des Restaurants. Der Kellner setzte sich zu bekannten Gästen an den Tisch. Der Rest des Lokals wurde ab dem Zeitpunkt ignoriert, was sowohl Speisen, als auch Getränke betraf. Nach einer halben Stunde wurde es selbst dem Koch zuviel und er kam in die Gaststube, um den Kellner darauf hinzuweisen, daß seit 30 Minuten unser Tiramisu auf die Abholung wartet.
3.Besuch -2 Paare- Im Sommer mal wieder ein Besuch. Restaurant relativ gut gefüllt und wir saßen auf der Terasse. Das man beim Bringen der Karte gleich die Getränkebestellung aufnehmen kann, war dem Kellner unbekannt, daher auch diesmal wieder lange Wartezeiten auf Essen und Getränke. Das Essen war nicht schlecht, aber so wenig, daß nicht einmal die beiden Frauem satt wurden. Unser Bekannter meinte dann auch zu seiner Angetrauten:""Eigentlich hätte ich gern mal bei Dir gekostet, aber als ich die paar Stücken auf Deinem Teller gesehen habe, habe ich mich das nicht mehr getraut."". Diesmal haben wir es dem Kellner auch mitgeteilt, daß niemand satt ist. Er empfahl uns noch Bruschetta oder Pizzataschen zu nehmen, was wir auch taten (natürlich auf Rechnung). Die anschließenden Ramazotti nach dem Essen waren natürlich brühwarm und der Getränkenachschub wie immer schleppend. Wir waren allerdings gut gelaunt und wollten uns dies auch nicht verderben lassen, so nutzen wir die Zeit um mal mit zu stoppen, wie lange die anderen Gäste so auf ihr Essen warten. Bei 2 jungen Burschen neben uns waren es anderthalb Stunden. Ein weiteres Paar fiel leider aus der Wertung, sie hatten zwar die Speisekarte erhalten, entschlossen sich aber nach ewiger Wartezeit auf die Bedienung zu gehen, daher mußten wir sie leider disqualifizieren. Irgendwann haben wir übrigens angefangen, unsere 8 leeren Gläser von Hefeweizen, Wein und Ramazotti am Tischrand in einer Reihe aufzustellen. Der Kellner verstand diesen ""dezenten"" Hinweis nicht. Das beim Kassieren das Weizenbier teurer war als ausgepreist, passte ins Bild.
4. Besuch-4 Kumpels- Ich wollte mit 3 Freunden und dem Zug in den Schwarzwald, also entschieden wir uns vor den 4 Stunden Zugfahrt noch eine Pizza zu essen. Es war Freitagmittag und die Gaststätte mittelprächtig gefüllt. Nachdem die Bedienung wieder auf sich warten lies, ging ein Freund zur Theke, um nachzufragen, ob wir in einer Stunde und 15 Minuten 4 Pizza haben könnten. Dies war laut Kellner nicht möglich. PS. Im Eiscafe Firenze am ""Berliner Platz"", wo wir anschließend hingingen, war dies trotz mittlerweile kürzerer Zeit kein Problem. Fazit: Obwohl es nur 100 Meter zu fuß sind, nie wieder ""La romantica""!!!!""",0,0,0,review

In einen Wohngebiet im Sindelfinger Westen liegt der bekannte Italiener ""La Romantica"". Die Ambiente ist südländisch und man kommt sich vor auf der terasse vor, als wäre man in den Ferien am Gardasee.

Wir waren am vergangenen Samstag zum Abendessen da. Wir haben dieses Lokal aufgrund von Bewertungen ausgesucht. Wir waren das erste und das letzte Mal dort. Siehe unten!
Bedienung
Wir hatten telefonisch einen Tisch für 2 bestellt. Vom Kellner wurden wir an einen Tisch platziert, der direkt neben dem Besteckschrank war. Aus diesem wurde während unseres Aufenthaltes permanent Besteck auf Teller geknallt und in gebückter Haltung an unserem Tisch vorbeigeschlichen.
Der Tisch wurde nicht vom Bestellkellner abgeräumt, sondern wortlos von einem Mann in Straßenkleidung, also mit Trenchcoat.
Das Essen
Zur Vorspeise hatten wir Carpaccio bestellt. Auf unsere Frage, ob dies mit Rucola sei, wurde selbstverständlich geantwortet. Auf meine Bitte, den Rucola wegzulassen, da ich diesen nicht mag, wurde mir geantwortet, das geht nicht,  dann machen wir es eben mit Eisbergsalat. Auf die Bitte meines Mannes, das ganze ohne Salat zu servieren ist der Kellner wortlos davongegangen. Bekommen haben wir dann ein Carpaccio, das über und über  mit rohen Champigons belegt war. Als unsere Vorspeisenteller abgeräumt wurden, wurden wir gefragt, wie es war. Meine Antwort, daß zu viele Champignons drauf waren, wurde mit einem Lächeln und Gemurmel quittiert. Ich hatte den Eindruck, daß ich nicht verstanden wurde.
Zur Hauptspeise hatte mein Mann Ravioli mit Kalbfleischfüllung mit frischen Karotten und Erbsen auf Tomatensosse. Das ganze kam sehr angetrocknet, die Karotten waren von der Form her Dose oder Glas.
Ich hatte Tagliatelle mit grünem Spargel auf einer leichten Gamba-Sahne-Sauce. Die Nudeln waren einwandfrei bissfest, die leichte Sahne-Sauce entpuppte sich als stopfende und viel zu schwere Sahne-Sauce.

Lage -  als Orientierungspunkt, das Restaurant befindet sich direkt am Wasserturm von Sindelfingen, direkt an einer relativ wenig befahrenen Durchgangstrasse . 
In der Nähe (ca. 10 Gehminuten) befindet sich eine S-Bahn Haltestelle;
Parkplatz - Mit etwas Glück in der Nähe vorhanden.
Publikum - Gemischtes Publikum,
Sehr gute Italienische Küche !
Das Lokal ist zu empfehlen !
Bedienung
Man wurde sehr freundlich und familiär begrüsst, wenn man aussen sítzen möchte, ist es ratsam vorher einen Tisch zu reservieren.
Der Kellner ging absolut auf unserer Wünsche ein. Wie z.B. eine Vorspeise, zwei Hauptgerichte zusammen, es gab automatisch 2 Teller, alles kein Problem !!!
Das Essen
Da wir das erste Mal dort hinkamen und der äussere Eindruck eher schlicht ist, umso mehr waren wir von der Qualität des Essens sehr positiv überrascht.
Wir hatten gemischte Antipasti, die lecker war. Der gemischte Salat mit hauseigenem Dressing war ebenfalls lecker. Die Krönung war, in der Kühlteke vorher zu besichtigen, das frische Lachsfilet. Garpunkt, Röststoffanteil und die Marinade - Alles Perfekt !!!! Nicht zu vergessen das Gemüse das ebenfalls sehr lecker zubereitet wurde.
Weinempfehlung: Als Erstes habe ich einen besseren Frascati getrunken. Der aber meinen Geschmack nicht entsprach. Auch hier kein Problem, der Kellner brachte eine Flasche weissen Ciro aus Sizilien öffnete ihn, obwohl wir nur 2 Gläser bestellt haben. Der Wein war überraschend frisch und nicht ölig also nicht zu schwer. Auch hier ein Volltreffer !
Es gibt auch eine eigene Pastaherstellung wo man zuschauen und natürlich bestellen kann.
Das Ambiente
Innen, einfach aber gemütlich. Aussen, sitzt man direkt an der Strasse wo ein wenig Verkehr herrscht.
Im Untergeschoss befindet sich eine Kegelbahn.

ich hatte bereits im Dezember 2010 eine super Kritik abgegeben und melde mich nun nochmal zurück: Mein Papa hat hier seinen 50. Geburtstag gefeiert, weil es ihm bzw. uns bereits 12/10 super gefallen hatte.
 
Der 50. Geburtstag meines Vaters war im La Romantica wirklich was ganz besonderes und im Großen und Ganzen ein gelungenes Fest - dank dem Team von La Romantica... Ein ganz großes Lob möchten wir dem Chef(Koch) und seinen anderen Köchen aussprechen! Das Essen schmeckte allen 14 Gästen hervorragend (und das will was heißen, wenn man es allen 14 recht machen möchte)!!!
 
Es gibt kaum ein Restaurant in der Nähe, wo Chef und Personal so auf die Wünsche seiner Gäste eingeht wie hier in Sindelfingen... Meine bzw. unsere Meinung bleibt bestehen - super Essen, super Ambiente, tolle Vorbereitung zu entsprechenden Anlässen, 100% Verlass auf die Organisation... DAUMEN HOCH... es war für alle ein gelungener 50. Geburtstag und wir kommen wieder und empfehlen dieses Restaurant von Herzen weiter...
 
Ganz liebe Grüße an das La Romantica Team - WEITER SO...

Die Fritto Misto kamen dann leider Portionsweise, wobei ich das ganz witzig fand: zuerst frittierte Tintenfischringe, anschliessend Lachs und Garnelen. War wohl so nicht geplant, aber gut gekontert .

Esse gerne und oft, überall auf der Welt! Das La Romantica begeistert mit der Frische, insbesondere der selber gemachten Nudeln. Die meisten haben ""frisch"" gekaufte Nudeln aus der Packung. Gemüse war knackig, die Idee des Baybspinatsalates kreativ. Pizza , suchtgefahr wie beim Pizzabrot welches kostenlos gereicht wird. Für die Umgebung(Arbeiterstadt) gutes bis sehr gutes Preis/Leistungverhältnis. Weinauswahl sehr gut und die Preise sehr Human. Unserer Kostet in einem StuttgarterRestaurant 30% mehr.

Letztens aß meine Begleitung ein Nudelgericht mit Steinpilzen und ich hatte mir eine Dorade gegönnt. Dazu gab es einen angenehm gekühlten Weißwein (Marani). Aber von vorn, nach Empfehlung des Kellners bestellten wir uns als Vorspeise jeweils einen Babyblattspinat Salat mit Früchtedressing. Bin zwar nicht so ein Salatfreund aber ich muss zugeben es war mal was anderes und ich werde es gerne wieder bestellen. Wie schon gesagt gab es als Hauptgericht ein Nudelgericht (frische Nudeln aus der hauseigenen Nudelproduktion) mit frischen Steinpilzen. Für mich gab es eine Dorade, es war außen kross gebraten und innen zart saftig, als Beilage gab es Bratkartoffeln in Weißweinsauce. Der Wein hat fantastisch zum Essen gepaßt, so konnten wir zur 2. Flasche nicht nein sagen.
Im großen und ganzen ist das Essen und die Gastfreundschaft sehr zu empfehlen, die Einrichtung und das Ambiente sind nicht modern aber gemütlich. Wir werden gerne wiederkommen um auch die die anderen Köstlichkeiten der italienischen Küche zu probieren!",0,0,0,review

Ich nahm per eMail Kontakt mit dem Restaurant auf und bekam direkt Antwort vom Besitzer der gleichzeitig auch der Chefkoch ist. Mit ein paar kurzen Mails zwischen uns, klärten wir in etwa die Speisenfolge für unser Menü und letztlich versprach uns der Chef er würde uns mit einem köstlichen Fünf-Gänge-Menü überraschen. Auf diesen Deal liess ich mich ein und das war definitiv kein Fehler sondern eine gute und richtige Entscheidung.
Als wir an dem Abend im Restaurant ankamen, wartete auf uns bereits ein liebevoll mit Rosenblättern, einem Rosenstrauß und einem silbernen Kandelaber mit aprikotfarbenen Kerzen dekorierter, edel mit Stofftischdecke und Stoffservietten eingedeckter Tisch.
Der äußerst freundliche Kellner begrüßte uns und führte uns zu unsere mTisch. Unaufgefordert brachte er uns dann sogleich je ien Glas Prosecco als Aperitiv und zum Anstossen auf den Abend. In diesem Moment erschien auch der Chef selbst. Er kam aus der Küche, begrüßte uns ebenfalls sehr freudnlich und erläuterte uns mit welchen Genüssen er uns nun zu verwöhnen gedachte.
Die Speisenfolge die er für uns ausgesucht hatte war folgende:
1. Lachstranchen auf Weißbrot mit gedünsteten Gemüsestreifen 2. Vitello Tonnato mit selbstgebackenem Pizzaofenbrot3. Teigtaschen gefüllt mit Ricotta-Scampi-Lachs-Farce auf karamellisiertem Spinatbett4. Gegrillter Wolfsbarsch an würziger Orangensauce mit Pizzaofenbrot5. Panna Cotta auf Kramellspiegel
Dazu empfahl er uns als Getränk einen Weisswein, den wir allerdings nach kurzer Diskussion (da wir lieber Rotwein trinken) in einen 2003er Vino Nobile di Montepulciano umwandelten.
Die Speisen die gereicht wurden, waren alle von erlesener Qualität und Frische. Jeder Gang - das war deutlich erkennbar - war vom Chef mit Kreativität und Hingabe zubereitet worden.
Die Speisen waren auf Geschirr unterschiedlicher Form, sehr dekorativ und liebevoll angerichtet und waren köstlich im Geschmack. Die Mengen waren eher zu großzügig denn zu knapp bemessen und wir konnten meist die jeweilige Menge nicht vollständig verzehren.
Das äußerst aufmerksame und dennoch sich dezent im Hintergrund  haltende Servicepersonal, sorgte dafür dass immer die Gläser mit Wein (der natürlich dekantiert worden war und in einem Dekanter gereicht wurde) und auch Wasser gefüllt waren, sowie wurde stets dezent nachgefragt, ob die Speisen und auch alles andere zu unserer Zufriednheit sei und ob ggf. etwas zusätzliches - wie z.B. ein Espresso zwischendurch - gereicht werden dürfe.
Die absolute Krönung dieses ohnehin genial positiven gastronomischen Erlebnisses kam am Schluss, nach dem köstlichen Dessert, als der Chef aus der Küche sich - nach vorherigem Fragen selbstverständlich - mit zu uns an den Tisch sass, uns noch einen hervorragenden Grappa als Digestive und auf Kosten des Hauses anbot.
Vorher hatte er allerdings noch gefragt, ob er ein Foto von uns an diesem besondern Abend machen und uns noch ein Geschenk zum mitnehmen anbieten dürfe.
Kurz, das Foto diente dazu von ihm auf ein T-Shirt gedruckt zu werden, das er uns als Abschiedsgeschenk überreichte und dabei sehr ehrlcih sich dafür bedankte, dass wir seine Gäste waren und ihn und seine Speisen und sein Team gelobt haben.
Der absolute Knaller kam nun aber ganz zum Schluss, als ich eher im Spass erwähnte, dass ich aufgrund des doch mehr als erwarteten Genusses von Prosecco, Wein und Grappa nun wohl doch ein Taxi rufen müsse und meinen Wagen dann eben am nächsten Morgen irgendwie abholen müsse. Da bot sich der Chef spontan an, natürlich nur wenn es uns recht wäre, uns mit unserem eigenen Wagen nach Hause zu fahren und sein Chefkellner mit seinem Wagen hinterher, so daß er wieder zurück kommen würde.
Wir haben das tatsächlich so gemacht und ich kann nur sagen, die Jungs und Mädels im La Romantica sowie das was sie bieten ist allererste Klasse und man wird so etwas und vor allem so eine Einstellung so leicht nirgendwo sonst finden!
Eines ist sicher, wann immer wir künftig in der Nähe sein werden, werden wir sicher dort wieder einkehren und ich bin fast sicher, vermutlich wie alte Freunde begrüßt und verwöhnt werden!
Fazit: Nicht nur empfehelnswert sondern ein absolutes Muss für jeden Gourmet und Freund italienischer Gastfreundlichkeit!
Übrigens, es soll nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass der zu entrichtende Preis für diesen genialen Abend inkl. allen Getränken usw. mit rund 100€ auch wohl als mehr als preiswert zu bewerten ist.",0,0,0,review

An sich ein schönes Lokal. Wir waren die einzigen Gäste. Macht einen leicht schmuddeligen Eindruck.. Sollte dringend Grossputz gemacht werden - damit das ganze wieder einladend wirkt. Ich bewerte selten - möchte damit den Besitzern helfen das Ganze wieder in den Griff zu kriegen. 
Bedienung war flink und freundlich.. Allerdings denke ich er ist sich bewusst dass es nicht perfekt ist - wir wurden zB nicht gefragt ob es geschmeckt hat
Bedienung
Sehr flink und freundlich. Essen wurde zügig serviert - sonst gibt es dazu nicht viel zu sagen
Das Essen
Pasta gut.. Pizza ist riesig. Geschmacklich allerdings hatte ich schon bessere Pizzen.
Vorspeise Tomate mit Mozzarella  für 7,50 konnte ich nicht fertig essen - der Käse war zu weich !! Richtig unangenehm beim Essen.. Wahrscheinlich zu lange gelagert.
Das Ambiente
Eingedeckte Tische sauber und ordentlich - Boden, Fenster brauchen Reinigung. Alle Tische auf der an sich schönen Terrasse sind nicht sauber - macht einen sehr schlechten ersten Eindruck.

Ich hatte die guten Bewertungen gelesen und beim Restaurant angefragt, ob am gleichen Abend noch ein Tisch verfügbar wäre und ob ich ein Candle Light Dinner buchen könnte. Man kann das Dinner mit einem 4 oder 5 Gänge Menü bestellen. Ich entschied mich für das 5 Gänge Menü (im Nachhinein hätten 4 auch gereicht, wir waren pappsatt). Der Koch erklärte uns persönlich die Menüfolge und gab eine Weinempfehlung. Auch Sonderwünsche (statt Apprikosenkompott wollte sie Erdbeerkompott) wurden berücksichtigt... für die Erdbeeren ist der Koch noch einmal extra in einen gegenüberliegenden Markt gelaufen ... einfach spitze. 
Der Tisch war mit Rosenblättern verziert, welche ein großes Herz bildeten. Ein 5facher Kerzenleuchter und ein paar Blumen machten den Abend perfekt. Das Essen war super und auch nicht all zu teuer. Für das 5-Gänge Menü + 2x 0,2 Karaffen Wein + 1L Wasser bezahlte ich ca. 80 Euro. Als Bonus machte der Koch noch ein gemeinsames Foto von uns und druckte es auf ein Tshirt für nur 10 Euro. Das war eine schöne Überraschung für meine Freundin und die 10 Euro alle mal Wert. 
Der Service war erstklassig, alle 5 Minuten schaute eine Kellnerin aus der Entfernung ob wir mit dem Gang fertig waren oder ob wir noch zu trinken hatten. Das war spitze. So gut bin ich noch niemals bedient worden, was sich auch in meinem Trinkgeld wiederspiegelte :)

Fries that came with children's menu mac 'n cheese were overdone, too brown & crunchy. Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.

Our waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too. 

Our waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), ""We don't combine cards!"" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.

Today's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again. It simply doesn't impress me with its service or its food.",1,0,0,review

The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff. 

Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner. 

So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please. 

The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere. 

The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.  

I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc..

Plus, no wait on a Sunday afternoon, which is the exact opposite of, say, IHOP.  We came for breakfast and were bowled away by how great the service was - the waiter had every possible configuration of questions on how we'd like out food, and even offered salsa as soon as the entrees came out.  I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs but sure, what the hell.  Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my buttery hashbrowns in it and going to town.  Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy.  My husband had an omlette which he seemed to enjoy, though the portion looked just a tad small.  Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more.  They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit.  I hope not, because I definitely will return.",0,0,0,review

Chicken Pot Pie ( ""NEW"" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3.50 frozen Swanson version you can cook at home.  Nothing remarkable here either.

French fries were hot and crunchy and good.  Best part of the meal.

Worst part:  The AWFUL chicken strips.  You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those.  There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside, then a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and then in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken.

I've never been overly impressed with 5 and Diner in the past, and I have to say, they met my mediocre expectations this round as well. My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast. None of which was better than what you can make at home, but it wasn't disappointing either.

Overall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills. However, here's where the problem comes in. When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife ""do you like bacon or sausage"", to which she replied ""bacon"". Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said ""the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra"". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine.",3,0,0,review

Okay, it's the sweet and sassy waitress.  She can sell me anything.  Even dessert, when I am not hungry.

The food is mediocre.  I recommend sticking with breakfast items.  On this last visit, we ordered dinner.  The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8.  Not bad.  

I somehow ended up spending $40+ for two adults and two kids on my last visit, even though kids were supposed to be 99 cents with the purchase of each adult entree.  

Part of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3.99 per slice of cake or pie.  Let me review that dessert now.

Carrot cake?  Nearly inedible.  With two people splitting a piece, 1/3 of it got eaten.  It tasted like it had been in a freezer.  DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.  The 9 year old girl who ordered it said... ""this does not even taste like carrots.""  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and then defrosted on the counter overnight.  

Cherry pie?  YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.  If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.

Still, the atmosphere is cute.  The decor is interesting for the kids.  

But if I ever remember that the food is blah, I will avoid this place.  I just don't ever seem to remember it until I am sitting there eating it!",4,3,0,review

However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.

We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.

My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.

M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.

Overall I'm extremely disappointed by this location. I now understand why there were so few people eating there as well.",0,0,0,review

Not even quite okay but just BLAH. I ordered the sliders. Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth: Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order. This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C. They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable but it was somewhat bearable. I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere.,2,0,0,review

The staff is wonderful and we are never left for wanting to say the least. Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice. 

The restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up but otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change!

Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.

Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.

Despite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.

It has a central location, Miami-ish décor, balcony that overlooks the Town Square park, and two additional balconies on both sides that are all perfect for people watching. Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot. 
However, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand. 

What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.

The sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly.

I had two strawberry.
The small plates were also delectable.  Each had their own personality.  And we even ordered the churros for desert.

This was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time. 

When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. 

The first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. 

Finally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent. 

I was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor. 

I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat. Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed.",2,2,2,review

I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas.  I found them to be tasty and well cooked.  Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable.  I had also tried their ""Fire Water"" drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well.  A bit of a small glass, but the flavor was good.

I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal, but my friend and I enjoyed our individual meal selections, and the overall vibe and view were pleasant.

But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your ""foodie"" DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said ""I wish I could try 5 plates"".  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.

If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?) 

- Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish ""cooked"" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) 

Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop. 

Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. 

Piggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have. 

- Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. ""Not as sweet"" as most. 

Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult. 

I want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square. 

Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason. 

I think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, ""I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had"" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it.

I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:

*Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.

*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly

*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. 

--------------------------

I've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.

We've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.

On the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. 

If you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better! You might just like it .",5,2,4,review

We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.

These are the tapas we ordered:
-Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.

-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum

-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.

-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.

-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.

-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.

-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.

-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.

-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.

-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.

-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.

Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.  

Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.  

Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...

This cost us $75 after tip. We left still starving after a day of laying by the pool in the sun, and grumpy for wasting money. 
The only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito. He probably used half the bacardi bottle on us.

The flatbread pizza: Grilled Chicken/mango/cilantro/queso blanco

Ambiance: 
low lighting, dark woods, modern feel, one big open room with tables plus outdoor patio seating which looked like it would be a great way to go in the Fall and Spring... they had cool (I thought they were cool) paper-like, scrunched lanterns hanging from the ceiling 

Menu: 
2-page menu.... 1-page for drinks and 1-page for food 
What's cool is that they keep it simple but it's not a far reaching menu like some other tapas places I've been to... and if you're vegetarian this is NOT the place for you... I think there were 2 items on the menu that did not have meat or were meat based 

Downside: (and this is why I'd give them 3 stars) they were out of a number of items 
- out of all but 2 wines 
- out of 2 of the 8 beers 
- out of the short rib tacos and some other dish that I can't remember 

Taste: 
Excellent... everything we ordered was very tasty and well executed with a flair for presentation. 
Note: the portions are not super big.... so each plate is good for 2 people... we often ordered multiples. 

Enjoyed the Tuna Ceviche... Chicken Empanadas (now these were on the big side).... Chicken Tacos... Fish Tacos... Crispy Shrimp 

Dessert: 
WOW! If you like bread pudding... or even if you are just mildly interested.... try their Banana Bread Pudding.... YUM! It doesn't look like much when it comes out... but then you take a bite. Oh MY! :) 
We also ordered the Churros which were more like Cinnamon twists.. nevertheless... very good as well and I dipped the churros in the sauce the BBP came in... oh Yea! 

Service: 
Our waiter was cool.... super busy as it seemed like he was only 1 of 2 guys taking care of all the tables and it was a pretty busy night... almost all the tables were filled plus a big party of 10

Drinks: 
I ordered the raspberry mojito... and to me ... it was way too sweet... I personally think it needed more rum and less sugarcane but that's me. Plus they muddled the heck out of it so that there weren't pieces of fruit swimming around as I had expected... I like the chunks of fruit in my muddled mojito... I know... I'm strange. 

The white sangria however was FABULOUS... it too was sweet but in a different way. I know... that doesn't make sense... so let's just say this drink would be perfect for sitting by the pool .... refreshing and delightful.

""I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you for taking the time to write a review of my restaurant, Caña.  I really appreciate it and I hope to see you in Caña again soon.  Please introduce yourself so I may say hi.

Regards,

Cory""


I replied that there were some request for new / additional drinks...

    Since Cana uses Rum and Sugar Cane in the majority of their drinks, 
    why not add some Polynesian drinks? A Mai-Tai made with Sugar 
    Cane as sweetener would sound deliciouso right about now!

    One of the best Iced Teas I've ever had was at a restaurant in 
    Sacramento where the Iced Tea (not the Long Island kind) was made
    with Sugar Caner.  Man... that sounds good in the Summertime in

I was very impressed with the waiter and the owner who were so welcoming and impressive with telling of what they enjoyed and the care that went into food preparation.

I had far more food that I normally do but was glad I tried out so many things.  I'll list it out since my eyes were very hungry that night.:

Hamachi - fresh and zesty
Duck Empanada - delicious unique butter crust and sweet to bite
Mac N Cheese - so bad for you but so good when it hits your lips
Calamari - crispy and peppery and using the dipping sauce really adds to the flavor
Pork Chops - Loved the marinade, tender, and full of flavor
Bread Pudding - This hit all my senses as soon as it hit the table and really lived up to expectations
Churros - Best churro I've ever had, arrived warm and hot and the glaze just really made the flavor jump in you mouth.

My friend had the white wine sangria and was very satisfied which is quite the compliment since she's very discerning.  I had a faux-jito, which was equally flavorful and fun.  Overall it was a great experience, nice ambiance, great service, and a welcome spot for friends, dates, and even business dinners.",1,0,1,review

Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):

Beef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.
Mac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.
Cuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.
Crispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.
Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.
Sangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.

During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.  Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far, but the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look.",1,0,1,review

The point is share the food tapas style but when you get tiny morsels of food (from $12+ a plate) its barely enough for one person to enjoy. (4 pieces of fish the size of quarters is $16??) Please. The service was good, and the ambiance is contemporary and inviting, however it's not the kind of place to indulge in, just feeling like snacking and paying $70 a person for basically an appetizer.

After 5-7 min waiting she came, put the menu in front of me and ask, with that very well known impersonal smile, ""what do you like to start"", ... I ask about Mojito, Seviche classic, ...and if there was any possibilities to turn the TV to sports, like soccer...(Consider the situation: World Cup; Brazil-Coast of Ivory game; only two girls and a guy at the bar talking on my left side and just me, in front of that TV, watching ""Jeopardy...."") The waitress told me: I don't like soccer, I don't watch it, so, I don't know where they broadcast the game"".  I just start  seeping my Mojito and forgot about the game. Minutes later came the seviche (tiny and good), and a second Mojito. 
Just before I finish, another couple arrives and ask about Brazil vs. Coast of Ivory's game, and then, just after 20-30 min after my first request, the bartender ask one of the guys working in the kitchen how to find the soccer game on ""...that TV""
Funny end: the TV audio was OFF=MUTE=SILENT (natural, in a bar environments, right?) and the waitress was swapping channels, back and forward, until I said, ""STOP...there is...that one...""

So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.

First of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.

Now for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the ""behind the bar"" area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.

As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even ""really good"" either.

- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.

- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.

- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.

- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.

- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.

- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.

We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.",1,0,1,review

We've lived in Vegas for a year and this was the worst food for the price we've had so far. We ordered the scallop ceviche, chicken flat bread, bacon wrapped dates, salad, and meatballs. The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked. I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces. Our meal ended up being $74 and we were beyond disappointed.

We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates. We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare. And we thusly found out there was no comparison. Cana's offerings were ok, but nothing outstanding. The food really felt like someone was reading receipts out of a cookbook and attempting to add their own ""flair"".

The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!

This visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.  

Speaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.  

But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.

Things to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!

My father and I arrived for happy hour at 6 and were told it had just ended! Luckily the cordial manager Mike let us indulge in happy hour since their yelp ad lists happy hour from 4-7pm.

First off, their happy hour prices are so inexpensive!! I posted pictures of the menus- beer $3, Cocktails 4.50, and a glass of wine for $3.50? Absolutely awesome.

The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing, but the flavours weren't really intermingled well. One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland. I definitely wouldn't write it off though.

Our cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria. Sierra Mist is the contributing sweetness : /

There was also an interesting selection of South American Beers!

Their Hamachi Tiradito was a winner, and entirely cooked as opposed to raw. Raw might have been more delicious, but sashimi isn't exactly tapas.",2,0,1,review

My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks; they love it so much that they are driven in a sugar frenzy to giving 4 or more stars. I can respect this. I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.

The atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the ""crispy"" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.  

I am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff. If I am at Town Square and someone wants to go back, I wouldn't be a party pooper. However, for now and based on the other reviews, I would say go to Cana for the drinks, but eat at Firefly.

They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say ""sorry you just missed Happy Hour"". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway.

The waitress that brought our food was different from the one who took our order, so seemed confused when I pointed out the steak was missing. However, she came back promptly with a big plate of steak to add to my salad and said it was ok, because my server had it down right but the kitchen missed it. The way she said it made me wonder what would have happened if the waitress had gotten it wrong . . .  Anyway, nothing terrible but I'd probably stop somewhere else next time.",0,0,0,review

The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say.  It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.

I am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.  

If nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.  

The food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant. 

The service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican). 

With all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less.  If you must try it then go ahead as it won't be a horrible experience, but don't say that you weren't warned.",2,0,0,review

John, the general manager, was professional and very friendly upon my initial inquiry and throughout the meal. My group ate in the small area to the right just inside the main door.

The service? It could not have been better. Angela and Joy spoke with me prior to the arrival of the other guests to make sure that everything was set up properly and to make sure that the guests would get the best possible service. They did a great job of getting drinks and food orders, offering suggestions, and generally having fun with the diners. Chips and drinks were refilled quickly and all the service was with a smile.

Everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered quite an array of entrees from tacos to fajitas. My meal, the stuffed poblano pepper, was excellent. Angela suggested adding spicy pork to it, but I was determined to have a meat-free meal today. The next time I will definitely try her suggestion. I thought the queso we ordered for our chips was outstanding. People gobbled up the fresh guacamole, which I personally thought needed just a bit more heat. The other suggestion one person made was that his meal also could have used a bit more heat. Needless to say, everyone left quite full and satisfied.

After lunch, a few of us relaxed at the bar, making for a great ending to a wonderful experience. Great food, great service and reasonable prices: quite a combination for a Mexican restaurant on the southwest side of Champaign.

We stopped in for an early dinner. We left filled and satisfied.  The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and ""naked"" with a spice ""rub"" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)

The main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.

The chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.  

The menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables. 

The place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those ""tall tables"" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.  

The wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.  

Parking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.

All in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign! I suspect it will become one of our regular stops.",4,0,1,review

When I took my first bite of the pork taco, there were so many flavors bursting in my mouth! It was spicy and juicy! Pork was cooked so perfectly! My mouth was definitely in heaven. Next, I had the most amazing spinach salad. There was a mild curry flavor and the tangerines and onions made it so crisp and fresh! That has been the best salad I have ever had. But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds. I am calling it the ""Magic Sauce"". I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale. I would definitely stock my pantry up with it. 
What I liked most is the variety they had. I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it.

I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made ""in house so they are extra yummy.""  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.

They have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.

I ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.

The burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then ""grill"" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.  Don't waste your time or money.

The waitress brought us chips and salsa. She was very prompt and helpful. Throughout our visit she was very quick to refill our drinks.

After quickly looking over the menu we both decided on getting the chimichanga. (My personal favorite) It seemed like the food took a bit longer than we were expecting but not too bad.

Once our order arrived, it looked delicious. However, that was not the case. As others have mentioned, the black beans have an off taste. The rice is pretty bland and underwhelming. Both the rice and beans were cold. The chimichanga is filled mostly with rice and beans which didn't help. Unfortunately, the entire meal was just rather mediocre.

Although the food wasn't the greatest, you do get large portions. My girlfriend and I decided if we tried coming again, we might just split an entree. She said she would give the restaurant 3 out of 5.

You get your food in seconds, but it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great. Not BAD, but not great. I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars.

I just started going a few weeks ago, and I've been there three times since. I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant. They do get pretty busy during dinner, but I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away. It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible.

You get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge. Their chips were fresh and light and warm. Nothing is a bad sign like bad tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. I have tried the guacamole and the queso. Of the two, I preferred the queso as an add-on dip for the Nachos. The guacamole was okay, but it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier.

Possibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based ""crust."" The crust of them is perfect. Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name. I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties. I preferred the pork overall, but both were full of flavor. Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful.

I've also tried their pork tacos. The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great. Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them. I did think their pork could used a tad more heat, but other than that they made a good lunch portion with the chips.

Desert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream! It's the best I've ever had. It seems like a hard thing to mess up too badly, but plenty of Mexican places that bother to offer it, do. It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle. It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better. Still, it's delicious.

As far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas. The first was a Blackberry and Basic concoction, and was my favorite of the two. I didn't get a ton of basil from it, but there was enough there to make it interesting. The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita. This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Neither skimped on the alcohol.",3,0,0,review

Food: HOLF SH*T SALTY. I mean SALTY. Like hey, want some food as a side to your jug of morton's salt with that? Now, I am not one of those people on a low sodium diet, where you body goes into shock consuming salt. I consider myself having a pretty normal diet. The guacamole was salty. Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty. Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all. I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence. We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat. I had the cheese enchiladas. HORRIBLE. It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it. No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through. 

Service: Meh. Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table. Server was new and didn't know the menu when we had a couple questions. When she saw that I only ate a bite of my food, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong or how she could fix it. Big no no. I was a server for 5 years and you just know when something isn't right with your customers. 

Drinks: Meh. I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup. Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice. 

We left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt. Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place.

Instead of regular sour mix they make fresh lime juice and organic agave nectar! How cool! The Roasted Blackberry and Basil Margarita by far is delicious. This combo goes great together.  However, my personal favorite is the Platinum Margarita. Instead of Triple sec, this one calls for a high quality and tasty ingredient called Grand Marnier--it makes the flavor so much better!

The place is kept very clean and tidy. 

The crowd of people who stay there were also pretty awesome. Some people were playing the instruments, others were playing card games, while others were cooking up delicious meals. It's a great place to meet some people to chill out and/or to explore the city together. 

The staff were also very friendly and approachable. They don't actually have 24hr reception there though, but they leave instructions in front of the door so you can get in the house any time of the day.  

The hostel was located right in the heart of the Old Port of Montreal, where most of the tourist attractions there. The Old Port is a gorgeous place to wander about at night. 

One bad thing is that the Internet was extremely slow when I was there (and it didn't work half the time), but this is something they may have fixed since then. There is also a pretty decent coffee shop down the road with Internet, so it's really not a big deal.",1,0,0,review

When we pulled up, we saw that it was in a great location. The guy greeted my boyfriend by his first name (remembering from the phone call a few hours earlier), checked us in, showed us around, and made sure we were good. The room was surprisingly nice, with windows looking out front. It was just under $80 for the two of us to have a private room. Given that this was my first hostel experience, I was quite pleased and made me think again about my thoughts on hostels.

The only somewhat negative thing I have to say is that because it's an old building, the windows aren't insulated and you can hear everything going on outside on the street, and also it gets a little chilly in the room. And the walls are thin and you can also hear everyone else in their rooms/common area, so if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs.

On my last trip here, I came with some friends to get some food in our systems before/during/after beers. We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink. In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi. I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed...) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it. As for the quality of my pizza? It was good. It was nothing to write home about, but it was good. I think the crust was kinda bland, but otherwise I was happy with it. The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too. My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well. As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3. (Thus the four-star rating)

Service here is always pretty quick and simple. Prices are ok (I paid like 7.80 for the meal, which is pretty good for the amount of food!) I'll keep coming back here when I'm in the Texas, for sure!",0,0,0,review

I think it's an enormous rip off, and I do not shop here for my usual grocery hauls. However, this Giant Eagle is right by my house, so whenever I need to run to the store for a random item or two (usually 2-4x per month), this is where I go. 

This Giant Eagle is very clean, well stocked, and has a very good selection. Their bakery, sushi, already prepared foods (like rotisserie chickens), salad bar, and wine selection are really nice. They also offer a lot of items that I have a hard time finding at other stores (a certain yogurt, bread, etc.) 

The employees at this location are split about 50/50. Half are nice and/or competent, and the other half are either rude and/or don't know what they are doing. For example, I was in there one day in the 12 items or less line, and this lady was trying to buy individual clementines. The cashier said they didn't sell individual clementines and wondered where she got them. Two other employees were also there (one was checking out, and another was from the self checkout area), and no one knew where these clementines were from. So theyre just holding up the already long line trying to figure it out when I informed them that they're the free ones that are for kids while parents are shopping. I hardly even come here and I knew that, lol. Really? Three employees had no clue? 

Another time I called to place a cake order, and apparently it was a real inconvenience to the bakery lady who was super rude evvvery step of the process. But whatever, the white cake with the satin (whipped) frosting from GE is so delicious that I'm willing to put up with rude employees to get it. 

But, I'll still give this location 4 stars because it's not a bad store, it's clean, and they're always stocked. The prices are a rip off, and they could use more cashiers, especially during busy times- but what grocery store doesn't have that problem. The parking also sucks because all of the people are whipping in and out of the parking lot in their luxury vehicles going to and from Crocker Park, Giant Eagle, and all the other shops in the vicinity, but if you like to live on the edge, it's not too big of a deal.",0,1,0,review

On the plus side, it is larger than many of the other Giant Eagles and, since it has more space, offers a better selection of many items than you get at the smaller stores.  It also carries more of certain items like prepared foods, sushi, wine, candy by the pound, and bakery than the Giant Eagles closer to Cleveland - I'm guessing this is due to its location in a more affluent suburb where people are more likely to spend on these products.  It also has more floor space devoted to seasonal items such as local sports memorabilia and (at Christmas time) Christmas ornaments, so I have found some interesting things to buy other than food here. 

On the minus side, the store layout is not very user-friendly.  Upon entering the store you have to navigate the large bakery, prepared food, wine and seasonal sections before you even get to the food.  I realize this is to encourage you to spend on these items but if you go in specifically to get a can of beans or a package of meat, it's a pain having to walk about a half mile just to get to standard food items.  The food aisles also don't go all the way through the store front to back.  Instead the aisle is divided in half by another aisle and different products are placed on the two halves of the aisle.  This has made it very hard for me to find things several times.   The store also seems to have way too much useless junk for sale, such as cheap children's toys and books.  Finally, this store always seems to have uniformed security guards hanging around prominently, making me wonder what is going on at this location to make that necessary, as I go to several Giant Eagles located closer to Cleveland and do not see this kind of ""security presence"" at any of them unless the police have been specifically called to deal with some incident.

I like the quirky little barrels for tables and such like.

My poor friend and I had been in a cheap little bar on the Cowgate where it was a pound a drink (my round, score!). Then we came in here and it was his round, unlucky for him. Vodka and coke and JD and coke came to just over £6. Poor guy was in shock! So a little expensive. But its quite fun and it has a good atmosphere with friendly bar staff.

This street itself is perfectly safe, but it does do its job in creating a fabulous mood - all it lacks is a haze of mist for you to navigate through on your way to the door.

Once inside the first thing you'll notice is a vast amount of sporting memorabilia - mostly Irish with a few exception such as a Sunderland shirt above the bar - perhaps donated by Anthony Stokes, but who knows how this shirt came to end up in this collection.

They have a good set up, with lots of open space, some huge booths and a stage at the far end. The interior is under George IV bridge so has a cool underground feel to it. As well as this they always have good bands on, nothing too original, all kinda Irishy / Folk / Rock covers but they are good fun, either to chill out to and have a chat, or to have a shimmy when it gets a bit more upbeat. Make sure to get there early (about half 12 / 1ish) because although it is pretty dead then, it gets full unbelievably quickly.

From an Irish bar you expect slightly overpriced drinks, Dropkicks is really bad. Expect to pay almost £4 a pint, and they are pretty average, including the Guinness which is not as good as you'd expect. Spirits and mixers are pricey too, and whilst I haven't had the wine, I would be surprised if that bucked the trend.

Everyone that comes here is always up for fun times and there's not a hint of pretentiousness about it, so you can make very little effort with your appearance, and no one will really care. But that could be because they've had too much Guinness and aren't able to distinguish who their friends are, let alone whether some random person has bothered to put mascara on or not.

What haunts me whenever I come here is Dropkick Murphy's previous life as a bar/club called Berties. They were some of the best days of my young life, I mean seriously good days, and I can't help but feel wistful whenever I'm here when I think about the Wednesday nights when all drinks were 50p, and sweat ran down the cave like walls. Happy times. Now the decor has been brightened up, but the stairs down to the toilets are still lethal, so if you've had a few, or you're wearing giant stilettos, creep down carefully, or you could end up in an embarrassing and no doubt painful tumbling situation.",0,1,0,review

As you would expect the walls are covered in Irish icons; rugby shirts, road signs and Guinness adverts and the staff are largely Irish. It has a small dance floor, however Dropkick's is not a night-club. It is spacious, with most of the room taken up by 4 or 5 large booths with a big table and seats. Since these are large tables it is common to share them with other patrons, which depending on your view of meeting people, can be a curse or a blessing. 
The drinks are typically priced for the centre of Edinburgh, with a pint of lager costing around £3. However, the main advantage to Dropkick's is that you can still be served up until around 3am, which means that if you are kicked out of another bar and do not feel ready for bed, or in the mood for a club, you can still have a drink in Dropkick's. In saying that, the music can sometimes be too loud for a conversation with anyone but the person sitting next to you. Also, on the weekend there is a door charge of around £2 after 11 or 12pm. Still, worth it for the craic.",0,0,0,review

The one thing that sets it apart from other bars in the area is that you have to pay to get in at nights and also that it's open an hour later than everywhere else. You're essentially paying for the slightly extended drinking time; paying money for the privilege of paying more money.


 Bonus!

However, every time I've come here since I was a student, I feel like Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon - I'm too old for this shit.  

As I said, it's heaving.  It's like, impossible to walk across the room without getting shoved, stepped on, spilled on, heaving.  Want to buy a pint?  Forget it.  It will take 20 minutes to get served and when you DO get your drink, some drunken punter will bump into you and spill most of it.  Then, when you try to go to the toilets to clean up you are faced with a long stairwell down (stairs + heels + alcohol = injuries) to a dungeon where at least one toilet doesn't work, another doesn't lock, and another doesn't have a toilet seat or tp.  

These things didn't bother me when I was a student and looking to have a few drinks too many and find a cute boy to snog (I seem to recall these were a dime a dozen here, but that may have been the drinks talking).

Back when I was a student and wanted somewhere with lots of buzz, vibe, cheap drinks, live music, and somewhere I knew most of my friends would end up on a Saturday night.

That was 5 years ago. This place really isn't my 'scene' any more. But I am trying to be unbiased and give it a fair review for what it is. A large venue, with live music, friendly staff, reasonable rates to get in on a Saturday night (£3 I think), and a decent crowd.

It's rough around the edges, definitely not glam (I'm not really that either...I'm just very indecisive!), and if they had a particular band playing here I wanted to see it'd be an alright music venue. It just feels a little 'old' and staid and not as fresh or funky as I like it (yes I just used the word funky and realise how ironic that is when used in the same sentence as 'fresh'.)

I also admit that I ended up here after several cocktails and a bottle of wine. So my memory is a *leetle* hazy. Again, not a normal Saturday night venture for me any more. But the staff were friendly which is always a plus. And it has that cool 'hidden under a bridge' thing going for it.

A group of us was bouncing around town trying to find a bar that was staying open to watch the NFL playoff games (Seattle/SF wasn't going to end until 3am).
The bar itself is pretty nice, I mean, it's a bar.  Large on the inside, lots of booths, TVs for the game.  Obviously it wasn't packed as this was late night Sunday, but I can see this place filling up on weeknights.  

The staff was really what made the place though.  Such cool guys... Marty and Cian were awesome.  I found people to be generally pretty nice in Scotland, but bartenders usually make or break a bar and I can't say enough about these guys.  Absolute all stars.

The bar is a bit off the beaten path and has a cool location under a bridge so if you're looking to get off the Royal Mile or out of Grassmarket (which you should), 100% pay a visit to Dropkicks, you'll be happy you did- and tell the guys Brian from Seattle said hi, they may hook you up with a Bloody Mary shot!",1,0,0,review

I do remember it being a hell of a night though. It's an Irish pub effectivly - but taken to extreme levels. The atmosphere is that of a roudy party, and there is so much drink around the place I'm suprised anybody ever makes it to the rather large dance floor. But they do, and unless you are prepared to throw yourself into the dancing, I'd step well back because you might get hurt. It seems that everybody in here is here for a bloody good laugh, a lot of drink and a furious dance - so over all the whole place has an amazing energy that I'm yet to come across anywhere else.

Some songs were straight up Irish jigs, others were like U2 with a Fiddle thrown in. It was an awesome place to dance, though it was totally crowded. The place was definitely expensive.

After reviewing the menu I decided to try something 'safe' so I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The meat loaf had very little seasoning, if any.  It had an odd taste.  It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges.  There was quite a 'crust' on it.  Overall, not appetizing at all.  The 'mashed' potatoes were quite lumpy.  I had to finish mashing them with the fork.  It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served.  Again, lack of seasoning, particularly salt.  Not good at all.   I didn't finish either item.

And when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register.  I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me.  She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills.  The response was, ""I don't know where she is.""  He then disappeared for a moment and then returned and said ""She will be with you in a minute.""   Not good customer service.

The whole meal was not very good.  While the price was reasonable, the food didn't live up to the hype that I received.  I don't think I would either recommend this place or go there again.  There are better places with food that is more appetizing.   A real disappointment for sure.",0,0,0,review

For an Italian sub, it was as good as it gets.  The jojos were decent... Good size, ok flavor.  The tenders left much to be desired... Too bland for our liking.

Second trip: we each had the Italian subs (of course!) and split a snack pack (4 whole wings & 2 jojos).  the subs, they were as good as the first time!  These subs are probably 8"", not the biggest but, big enough and with great flavor!  The jojos were as they were the first time but the wings were delicious!  Much more flavor then the tenders.

I have been going here for years and there have been a lot of different employees over the last 10 years. I have never had a bad customer experience at this location though. The staff is always very friendly. Especially for some of the people they put up with on a daily basis since this place isn't in the best area. 

I do highly recommend this place for the pizza by the slice if you aren't too uppity to visit a store in a low income area. There are some sketchy looking characters around sometimes but nobody has ever bothered me in the 10 years I've been going there.

The kitchen serves up hot, made to order pizzas (also available by the slice), subs, fried chicken, and jojos at very reasonable prices!  Fellow Yelper, Darren R has been raving about the delicious Fiery Gauntlet sub for a while and he has reason to because that sammich and the Italian sub I've tried have been really tasty!  They come loaded with savory deli meat and cheese sliced fresh in house with fresh, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion finished with a smidgen of creamy Italian dressing, nicely toasted on a seasoned hoagie roll...all for around $4-$5.49.  
I've had the pizza by the slice and it's pretty good at $1.69 for one slice or $2.99 for two slices!  You can order a whole pizza any way you'd like it too.

All it took was the words ""Churrasqueira"" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like ""Carniceria,"" which always means good food.

I parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.

About the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old ""hi there, let me know if you have any questions!"" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.

Initially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.

Before I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.

The chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.

All too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there. Ahh yeaa.",0,0,0,review

Tasty and good value?  Definitely!

This completely unassuming super authentic Portuguese place is located in currently trendifying and hipsterfying part of Dundas West between Bathurst and Ossington.  Decor is minimal with a TV.  Expect to see lots of Portuguese families in this casual, casual joint.

The FOOD was all decent with some hits and misses.  The grouper was quite tasty, although we weren't sure that it was actually grouper.  The half chicken was probably the best dish of the night and came with a delightfully spicy dipping sauce.  The steak, which I ordered medium rare,  was served on the well done side of well done; however, the flavor was actually good.  I don't get why places ask about steak temperatures if it's not going to make a difference anyway.  Fries were pretty limp.

SERVICE was friendly and very casual.  Definitely not a place to come if you're in a rush.  The food took a long time to come out, but the free bread and olives helped with the wait.

Over the last couple years however, we had a family pass to the YMCA just a few blocks over. Since we could put my son in swimming lessons there for no extra cost, we just went there. However, my son has a bit of apprehension in the water. He gained some skills in their lessons, but he was stagnating over time.

We've known a few people who enrolled their children at Making Waves, and one thing I knew right off the bat that would make them ideal is the max of 3-1 child to teacher ratio. I can't emphasize enough how important that is, as I watched my son at his previous lessons have to wait several minutes at a time for his turn when there were about 5 in his class.

From what I've seen, the instruction is also at a high level. One example is previously my son was learning to float by having the teacher hold him under his shoulders and pull them along the water. Here, the teacher actually helps support him more under his lower body. It makes sense, as the upper body is where the body floats, with the lower body being prone to sink being only muscle and bone. This technique seems to give the student a better sense of learning how and then trusting their body to float. They also do a great job of helping push students just outside of their comfort zone. Enough to encourage learning, but not enough to scare them too much. For example, for some of the lessons you'll see the teachers count loudly to 5 as the student is doing their best to stay afloat when swimming,which seems seems a reasonable amount of time for them to push through, without worrying about being under too long.

Terrific facility as well, with a huge viewing area to watch the lessons, a play area for kids who may be waiting, and a nice change area. A terrific thing about this place is that they use salt water as a natural cleanser/disinfectant for the pool rather than chlorine. It improves the smell, but I'm sure it's better for skin too.

It is naturally more costly to attend here than most other places. I can't fault them for that given the details above; but I wish they'd offer the 10% discount for the second child rather than only if you have 3 attending. Many don't have 3 kids to begin with, and I think a 10% is still a fair deal if family have 2 children attending given the cost.

It is what it is, but ultimately, everything is at a high standard. One month of lessons in, my son has progressed at a rate that may have taken 6 elsewhere.",0,0,2,review

 Service tadellos, zuvorkommend, freundlich. Wir haben sogar einen Schnaps auf Kosten des Hauses bekommen.


 Und das Essen: Sehr gutes Fleisch von südamerikanischen Rindern, genau richtig gegrillt. Dazu leckere Kartoffelecken. Auch der Baked Potato am Nebentisch sah gut aus, ebenso der gemischte Salat und der Beilagenspinat. Und das Erstaunliche: sehr humane Preise (z. B. 180 gr-Steak für 11 EUR). Außerdem auf der Speisekarte: Fisch und Meeresgetier, Vegetarisches, sogar Maultaschen und ein paar weitere schwäbische Zugeständnisse.


 Große Sonnenterrasse, schöner Spielplatz für Kinder, ausreichend Parkplätze vor dem Haus. Sogar eine Kegelbahn gibt es. Für Gruppen lässt sich ein Teil des Restaurants abteilen.

Es liegt nur ca. 20 Gehminuten von S-Hoffeld entfernt. Das Gebäude gehört wohl irgendwie zum TSV Birkach der dort diverse Sport-stätten betreibt. Vermutlich war es mal die Vereinsgastätte. Überbleibsel finden sich in der teilweise übernommenen Inneneinrichtung wieder u.a. (hellbraune Holztische) 
Es gibt einen Tresen und ausreichende Sitzmöglichkeiten die den heutigen An-sprüchen angepasst wurden. Trotz allem blitzt das Sportlerheimambiente durch, dem sollte sich jeder Besucher bewusst sein. Zum Essen: Das Angebot (bis 1.4.10 nur Mo/Di/Do) versprach 200g frisches Filet-Steak mit Beilagensalat für 15 EUR pro Person ! Der (gemischte) Salat wurde vorab auf einem kleinen Teller mit Dressing serviert. 
Er überzeugte durch seine Frische, kein Billigkraut aus dem 10-Liter-Eimer, bis auf die Gurkenscheiben, die wohl schon länger aufgeschnitten rumlagen. Das Steak wurde kurz drauf aufgetischt. Garniert mit einem großen Salatblatt, ein kleines Stück Kräuterbutter und Danke der Küche eine Portion Kartoffelecken ;-) Das Steak war nicht ganz nach meinem Wunsch gebraten, was ich aber nicht reklamierte. Es war sehr schmackhaft, zart innen und aussen lecker kroß angebraten. Wirklich sehr gute Qualität. Fazit: Gutes Essen zu angemessenem Preis, sehr freundliche und nicht aufdringliche Bedienung.

Sie waren sehr groß und das Fleisch war zart und saftig.
Meine Beilage, ich glaube es waren so dickere Pommes, war ok.
Ich hätte sie lieber etwas knuspriger gehabt.


 Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich.


 Alles in allem ein sehr schönes und gutes Steak Restaurant welches auf jeden Fall ein Geheimtipp hier in der Umgebung ist.

The best overnight staff member is Dora -- she has seen me in various states but she is always so lovely and pleasant. I'll be sad if she ever stops working there.

This Sobeys used to be an IGA a few years ago, so the place has renovated quite a bit, but it's still not as modern as some of the larger grocery stores in the city.

Then I waited for 10 minutes at the only open cash. I asked the security guard what the deal was, and he replied ""the checkout guy is in the bathroom"". Ten minutes in the bathroom while you're the only guy working seems a bit ridiculous to me. 

When the guy finally returned, of course I commented on how long myself and the others in line were waiting. He did not take kindly to this and actually grabbed my hand when returning my change and wouldn't let go. It was creepy and aggressive. 

I was going to complain to Sobeys about this guy but I figure he's probably  got a criminal record and this is the only job he can get, so I'd feel bad if he was fired.

They also have a ""we boil while you shop"" scenario which isn't for this east coast gal, but it seems like a really good option for many.

Fast forward to today - I now really enjoy shopping at Sobey's.  As a parent of little ones, I'm so grateful that they have this Free Fresh Fruit for Kids deal near the front entrance, by the produce.  Shopping for groceries is one of the dullest things to put a young kid through, and this treat they offer to all kids (12 and under) is a joy in keeping both myself, the kids, and fellow shoppers, happy.

The prices, in general, are fair.  Sale prices can be good!  (Love their deals on almond milk, sometimes 2 cartons for $7; or Haagen Daaz for $4.99).   Freshness is similar to what you'd expect to find.

Air Miles collectors will appreciate earning 1 point for every $20 spent.

Spending $40 or more will currently get you a receipt offering .04 cents off a litre of gas at a Shell gas station, although there's a gas station with competitively priced gas (we're talking about savings similar to that at Costco's).

We come here with our dog, put him near the large front windows, where I can shoot a glance his way as I shop.  There is a lovely woman who works within this Sobey's.  She is a true dog person with a gold heart.  I've seen her come out to say Hi to our little guy more than once.  Met her by first name today.  I love seeing this genuine, caring side in people.

There was another time where the person who was restocking on some Haagen Daaz ice cream, opened a new case of ice cream, just to provide me with a very frozen container.  It wasn't easy to get to.  This gesture was appreciated.

I'm finding that people who work here are just lovely, real people.  Nice people.

Funny how they have products that link up to famous chefs, like Jamie Oliver, and a few others (see their pesto, pasta sauce, and frozen food sections) to other chefs that are famous but that I can't think of by name right now.

Yes, I certainly will go again.  Yes, I definitely recommend for people to try this Sobey's out.

There are over 30 flavors to choose from, and multiple flavors can be added into the same cup!  This place is extremely generous with the syrup quantity too.  Feel free to save the, ""We want more!  We want more!"" in this case!  
Most of the flavors are on the sweet side, so if you're not a fan I suggest grabbing a sugar free flavor or a sour flavor (the word sour will be in the name).

Don't forget to add the ice cream!  The only flavor offered is vanilla, but it is delicious and compliments most flavors (sour flavors not so much)!  The ice cream is very smooth and creamy.  

By the way, this little shack is located in a gas station's parking lot.  If you're planning to drive away immediately after receiving your order, I suggest asking for your choice of size served in a bigger cup.  For example, I normally have my medium serving placed in the cup meant for a large serving.  The cups normally have 2-3 inches of shaved ice stacked above the rim, so this is a good option for busy-bodies like myself.

One last note, the staff definitely deserves recognition.  Every worker that I've come across during my visits is always wearing a smile and has a goofy personality that can make anyone smile.

The daughter has only had Blue Rasberry and while she won't ever share with me I can speak to her Smurf blue lips and tounge when she finishes.

The only down side to the place is that they don't have ample parking or a bench to sit and eat your treats. I can trust my teenager enough not to get syrup all over the leather in my car but if you have young kids they will either be running around a parking lot amped up on Sugar or sitting in your vehicle making everything sticky.

The only thing I don't like about it is the location. Must eat when at the mall! We even drive there once in a blue moon just for the food.,0,0,0,review

My mom, 2-year-old, and I dropped into John's on a Wednesday at 10:30. I was pleased at how quiet and drowsy it was inside, yet we still got greeted enthusiastically and the waitress tended to us right away. Something tells me that if we were to come in at the same time on a Saturday, it would have been packed, but we would have still been acknowledged and served in an efficient manner. It's just that type of place and seems to be run really smoothly.

Two things I was surprised about: their corned beef hash is, like, REAL. No crap out of a can (though I will always hold a special place in my heart for that salty gruel). It tasted great and came out fast. The second thing: they have a sign on the table boasting their own root beer made with cane sugar. I hate root beer, but that's pretty impressive.

 My daughter had a short stack of blueberry hotcakes and we had more than half left over because they were huge and hearty. My mom requested that her omelette be made with egg whites only, and they did that with no problem. 

The coffee wasn't AMAZING, but it was better than average, hot, and the refills kept coming. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive.

As for cleanliness - I've definitely eaten in cleaner joints. I've never been in the bathroom, not even sure if they have one. Also, I wouldn't look at the floor if I were you...

The reason John's gets 4 and not 3, is they have what I call a great 'diner waitress'. A great diner waitress is somebody who is very efficient, never misses anything, and always keeps your coffee hot. She calls you 'hun' or 'sweetie' but it somehow isn't patronizing like it is when other people say it. Don't know her name and she's very young but she is great and is always there.

Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, ""Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you...""

John's Diner will serve you, but on its own terms.  They treat you like people; they're happy to see you, but they've been around for fifty years and will be around for fifty more.  The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders.  They have that quiet pride that says, ""If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door.""  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, ""Now, what did you want THAT for?""

As such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.  

The food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.

Would I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?  No.  But would I take them here the morning after a night out for comfort food?  You betcha.  Would I go here myself when I'm tired of exotic foods and just want a damn sandwich?

It is also the weirdest dining experience I have experienced in all my years...

So I've driven by quite a few times and it struck me as a place the locals go when they've had one too many or maybe a place some of the locals frequent for a weekend hangover cure. 

To preface this, I'm under the impression that things were going through a change on this first and last visit here. There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the ""chef"" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. 

So, anyhow, the story:
Two adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. 

Let's order!

So the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. 

Each meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. 

The soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they ""of the dayified"" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.

Spaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. 

The roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.

While that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the ""chef"" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the ""sauce"" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. 

The ""chef"" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it ""Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles""!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. 

I sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. 

The waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. 

She asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). 
So we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......
So I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means.",2,8,1,review

I called the number on the website the next day and the call went straight to voice mail (the v/m didn't even announce ANY company name, just a machine tone then silence) I wrote another email made several more attempts to phone them then searched the web for reviews/ratings of this company. To my dismay I found this site and one other with similar correspondence.


 What I did
-I threatened to contact the Edinburg trading standards. 
-Contact the bank and request they charge back the transaction.
-Call my brother in-law who (luckily for me) lived literally just down the road from Aktive8/EH3 9AN.


 Result : 1 week after the initial order & payment I received four replies, apologies and a confirmation that a refund has been made back into my account.


 If it wasn't for people who posted on this site I would probably still be wondering what the hell is going on with this company. Instead I got on their case straight away and managed to get a good result. Thanks to those who have posted before me.",0,0,0,review

 Aktive8 are an online Outdoor Gear & Leisure store based in Edinburgh with only a few staff (source: corporate192.com). I just thought I'd mention my recent experience with using Aktive8. If you decide to buy from Aktive8 be warned should anything go wrong and you need to return a faulty product, expect potential trouble.


 Active8 seem to be only interested in taking money and not providing any quality support or customer service.


 Ordering was fine but the product was faulty. Returned following instructions on website. The level of response I received was in stark contrast to that suggested in the Warranties section of the Aktive8 website.


 Nearly four months later I had still not received a refund or replacement. I eventually received a refund, without an apology or explanation of the delay.


 Aktive8 has a telephone number (premium rate) that only answered by a recorded message stating 'all lines are busy'. If you call at midnight on Sunday you'll hear the same message. If you call on one phone and get the message, then call on another simultaneously, the second phone gets an engaged tone.


 Emails are read, but not responded to. I did receive a single email stating that 'there has been a delay'. No apology or explanation of why.


 Appalling customer services. I would AVOID at all costs. I'd personally recommend http://www.wiggle.co.uk - they have a tried and tested reputation and offer discounts too.


 It appears I'm not alone in this either. If you read the reviews at
http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews173957.html 


 If you need to contact Aktive8 don't use the costly 0871 231 8888 number it has the recorded all lines are busy message, so does 0131 228 5047. Use the shop number on 0131 228 3003. There's no guarantee that anyone will answer it took many days of trying before anyone answered.",0,0,0,review

I contacted Jennifer requesting package info and price quotes for hair and make up 1.5 weeks prior to my engagement photo session. She replied within 12 hours with a friendly email explaining what she had to offer. After reading an offer I couldn't refuse, I called her to ask any remaining questions, which she gladly answered and decided to ask her to send me a contract, which was sent promptly via email. She requested that I email her with my ideas of what ""look"" I wanted to achieve for my photos. She said that I could email/text her pictures of my ideas and what I like. She also asked me to send a picture of myself so that she could ensure she'd have the right colors to match my skin tone. Once I emailed her with photos and information on what I wanted, she provided me with advice on how to prep myself for the day of the shoot.

 She gladly offered to come out to conduct our appointment at the hotel we were staying at on the strip. She arrived early...EARLY - about 6:45 AM for our 7 AM appointment. She set up in our bathroom and we got to work. She did mermaid curls for me and did airbrush makeup. She informed me that the makeup might look a bit heavier than what I had requested, as photo shoot make up needs to be a bit heavier. She ensured me that the right look would still come out in the photos. She was spot-on right. I did think the make-up looked heavy in person, but when I received my photos from the photographer, the make-up could not have been more perfect! Had it been any lighter, I may have been disappointed. I could not be any happier with the look that she helped me to achieve. It was very natural, but heavy enough so that my features would come out in the pictures. My curls stayed intact beyond our session, so I was able to have fun with them while walking around in Vegas.

So I ended up canceling my services with Muse for my wedding.  I had contracted their services almost a year ago for wedding hair and makeup.  At that point they had rave reviews on wedding wire and yelp.  However, things have taken a turn for the worst in 2014 by the company, as evidenced by the other reviews on this site.  Even from the get go, I had difficulty receiving an email with the contract.  Jennifer, the owner, attributed the delay the first time to problems with the email: info@museartistrylv.com.  Eventually, we sorted that out.  Email problems happen, so I figure no big deal.  Fast forward to my engagement hair and makeup, that went off without a hitch.  So there are the two stars from my experience from August 2013 (see my other review).  So fast forward, I'm a little over a month out from my wedding. I schedule my trial hair and makeup way in advance and even send an email confirming time and date.  My trial time is 11am...I just happen to check my email while waiting for them to show up for the trial.  In my inbox is an email, sent that morning, canceling for the day since one of the artists is ill. Okay, illness happens but as a professional company and owner you need to pick up the phone and call your client. An email is not an acceptable form of cancellation. So I pick up my phone and call to see if I can reschedule, no answer on her personal cell or the company phone number.  The best part is the voicemail that states leave your info and we will get back to you in 24 hours.  I also email both emails again asking for someone to call me regarding rescheduling.  Yeah...don't count on a response in 24 hours. Fast forward 4 days later, I again send another email and leave voicemails on both numbers requesting contact.  I decide at this point to send a text message with something along the lines of please let me know if I need to start looking elsewhere for hair and makeup services.  I finally get a text message stating that her phone had died and that she would make my next appointment a priority.  Okay, I get your phone died but you clearly still have access to email since you sent me one to cancel the morning of the trial.... I follow up by asking who the artists will be for the trial, it ended up not being the same two listed on my contract.  She did sound sincere, as sincere as you can be on text message regarding the cancellation.  But after I reviewed all my email correspondence with her, this is the second time she has had problems with her iPhone.  She may indeed have very poor luck with her phone....might I suggest a land line or one not routed to your cell phone. But at this point, I had a decision to make....do I worry about being stood up on my wedding day via email or do I find peace of mind and cancel. The choice was easy, I'll consider my deposit a donation and move on.  However, I did the responsible thing in this break up.  I did try to call to cancel, but surprise no one picked up.  I also emailed and texted just to be on the safe side.  She did respond to the text.  I will tell you that IF they show up you will probably get good value for services rendered, since I shopped around and they were the lowest priced packages.

It would have been about two months ago, I used to live a stone's throw away from this location and whenever I was feeling particularly lazy, or lax about spending money I would shop here.  Employees were always friendly and whenever I needed a quick feta fix or a last minute bit of cilantro for for finishing my revered spicy Thai peanut sauce this was my spot.

So as I was saying before my ramble, I experienced the ultimate in ""feel good"" moments here a few short months back.  I was picking up some produce and must have been shaking my head visibly at the astronomical cost of everything, when I was approached by an aisle clerk who covertly pointed me in the direction of what appeared to be a shopping cart set aside.  I thought that my eyes had deceived me. This cart was brimming with produce!  Many of the items I had in my hands were in said cart and I was informed that they would be throwing them away, but that if I wanted they may be able to sell to me at a marked discount.  I jumped at this opportunity and was actually able to buy three times what I needed at half the price.  I made a vegetable heavy pasta salad, cous cous, and vegetable noodle soup, and was super happy that I was allowed to find a home for these soon to be discarded items.  Definitely a feel good moment for both my wallet and soul.

I don't know if this act of charitable kindness was against store policy, and hope that I'm not getting someone who committed an admirable act in trouble with management, but something like this should be commended and not condemned.

Sorry to be so open but i get brazillians and this place SUCKS. when i started i was kinda shopping around trying to find a place i liked and someone that made me comfortable.

I didnt do it again for a while until i found Donato's and found my lady. the only other 2 times i have gone here was because my lady was gone and this place was easy and convenient. After the last time I will NEVER EVER GO AGAIN. first off, if your an esthetician you should look like you take car of yourself because you are promoting your work. Its like going to a hair dresser and her hair is a nest of mess....would you want her to cut your hair? NOPE. Anyways this girl just was overly tanned with avatar make up and looked like she didnt take care of herself at all. this kind of put me off but i just figured whatever i will go with it. the room they put you in is cramped and is not very warm or comforting. You kinda feel like your in a box. The girl started doing her thing but she was horrible. she was not gentle (and believe me you can be gently during this process) and the wax was too hot. I had burns and bruises it was not fun. She layed wax over the same spots twice or three times to get 1 hair she could have plucked out. ANYONE who gets waxed from a professional knows you CAN NOT put hot wax over the same spot twice...it causes burns. I also used to work in a spa so i know these things. She was just not friendly to me at all and was so rough with me. I did not like this at all. But you get what you pay for, its cheap for a reason i guess. 

In a situation like that i like being comfortable and relaxed and i was not. I wouldn't suggest anyone go here if you consider your body a temple.

It was an odd situation to find myself in--a gaming shop, several hours after normal stores close for the night, kind of drunk.  

BUT!  They had a fantastic array of nerdy games.  Teej and I admired these for awhile, vowing that we would return to patronize the store should we be in need of nerdy games in the near future.  The owner also told us that if we wanted something he didn't have, he'd special order it and we'd get 10% off.  How's that for service?

Here's to you, nerd store!  I tip my hat in your direction.  You've bested my Spaniard.",1,0,0,review

You can tell that Lani is very experienced and genuine when it comes to cutting hair, I left satisfied and happy. She stated that many asian salons thin out your hair too much (which is entirely true), so Lani takes extra care to ensure this does not happen.

Asked for long layers and only a little taken off. Despite the hairstylist saying ""we will just take a little off and keep it long"" multiple times during the hair cut - I still left with 5-6 inches off. I wanted long layers and apperantly to the stylist that meant only for two strands in the front. I kind of look like a school girl whose mom cut her hair. On top of all of this, the hair washing portion sucked. I look forward to having someone else washing my hair whenever I get a cut and this was nothing to write home about.

We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed.  I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out).  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars.

Seating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside.  As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table.  You will need this when placing your order at the counter.

I was a little surprised when we got there, as I expected a sitdown restaurant, but instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place.  There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down...

We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.  There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry.  I also had some of my wife's sandwich after she was done, and thought it was good, bagel was nice and warm still.

The bistro is attached to an art gallery that features art and handcrafted pieces from local artists.

My friend was interested in trying this place because of the fried green tomato BLT and she said that it did not disappoint! 

I ordered the turkey pita wrap with black eyed pea hummus (that I requested on the side) asiago french fries with a cucumber rittiata (sp?) dipping sauce.  My meal was delicious! In fact, I have been thinking about it all day.  

All of the ingredients were fresh and extremely flavorful.  The hummus tasted like they had just prepared it as I ordered (and not took it out of a pre-made package).  The only gripe I had was that my turkey pita was served in a tortilla NOT a pita.

For beverages, we both ordered the White Peach Iced Tea and it was very refreshing.

I found the prices to be quite reasonable, not at all extravagant.  The price of my turkey wrap was $8.50 and the drink was $2.50. About the same as you would pay at any mid-level chain restaurant.

I look forward to coming back and trying the fried green BLT and just about everything else on the menu.
